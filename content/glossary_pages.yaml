    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisa100yearflood\">What is a 100-year flood?</h2>\n<p>The term “100-year flood” sounds like it’s a flood that only happens every 100 years, but it actually refers to a statistical probability. Specifically, it describes a flood that has a 1% chance of hitting an area in any given year. An area that has a 1% chance of flood is on the 100-year floodplain.</p>\n<p>One part of protecting areas near water sources is to figure out the probability of different size floods. That way, people know how much flooding to expect and can take measures to guard against damage. The 100-year flood is simply one way of describing the likelihood of an area having a flood of a certain size, and it’s a baseline the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP) uses for determining when <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is mandatory for an area. For this reason, the 100-year flood is also called the base flood.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that while the 100-year flood is a statistical expectation, floods can happen more or less frequently. They can also be more severe than anticipated, with water going much higher than expected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whereisthe100yearfloodplain\">Where is the 100-year floodplain?</h2>\n<p>NFIP flood maps identify 100-year floodplains throughout the US and groups them in <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a> based on their risk. In addition to floodplain boundaries, flood maps show any base flood elevation or flood depths for the area. The following flood zones are in a 100-year floodplain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Zone A</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Zone AE</a></li>\n<li>Zone A1-30</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">Zone AH</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">Zone AO</a></li>\n<li>Zone AR</li>\n<li>Zone A99</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-v/\">Zone V</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Zone VE</a>, V1-30</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because these zones are on a 100-year floodplain, they are labeled as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SPHA). This makes flood insurance mandatory for anyone with a federally backed mortgage.</p>\n<p>Not every flood zone has a 100-year floodplain. For example, areas with minimal-to-moderate risk for flood, like <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-c/\">Zone C</a> and <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Zone X</a>, are above the 500-year flood level, meaning their chance of seeing a base flood is 0.20% per year. Another example is Zone D that has an undetermined flood risk and may or may not meet the 100-year flood designation.</p>\n<p>You can search for your property’s flood zone at the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">Flood Map Service Center</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisbasefloodelevation\">What is base flood elevation?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevation (BFE)</a> is the height water surface is expected to reach during a 100-year flood in a given area. The NFIP and private insurance companies use BFEs to determine how much to charge for flood insurance, and building contractors also consider BFEs when building homes in flood zones. In fact, the NFIP mandates builders follow certain regulations on 100-year floodplains, such as elevating living spaces above the BFE.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesbeinginthe100yearfloodplainmeantohomeowners\">What does being in the 100-year floodplain mean to homeowners?</h2>\n<p>Most importantly, federally backed and regulated mortgage lenders can only loan money to homeowners in a 100-year floodplain if the homeowner gets flood insurance. That may seem extreme if you focus on the area’s 1% risk for a base flood in a given year. However, you can also think about what that means over a 30-year mortgage, where your chances for a 100-year flood is 26%</p>\n<p>A 100-year flood doesn’t happen very often, but when it does it’s catastrophic. Moreover, they aren’t the only flood you have to worry about. Other floods may not be as severe, but they occur more often, particularly if they have a lower elevation or are closer to the water, and can still cause significant damage. For example, if you’re close to the water, you may be subject to a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>45% change of seeing a 50-year flood.</li>\n<li>71% chance of seeing a 25-year flood.</li>\n<li>96% chance of seeing a 10-year flood.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flood risk over the course of owning a home can be very high –&nbsp;especially if you consider the chance of your home catching fire is usually around 1% or 2%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectinghomesin100yearfloodplains\">Protecting homes in 100-year floodplains</h2>\n<p>Most people with homes in the 100-year floodplain go to the NFIP for flood insurance. However, all NFIP policies have a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30-day waiting period before coverage kicks in.</li>\n<li>$250,000 cap your home’s <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>$100,000 cap on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings coverage</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At Kin, we can offer flood insurance attached to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy with none of these limitations. In fact, your policy starts the moment you pay for it.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisactualcashvaluecoverage\">What is actual cash value coverage?</h2>\n<p>Actual cash value (ACV) in homeowners insurance is one way to determine how much your property is worth. The actual cash value of your home or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a> is calculated by subtracting an amount for depreciation, deterioration, or obsolescence from the replacement cost.</p>\n<p>Depending on the state, the replacement cost may include labor, taxes, fees, installation costs, and material. But when you insure property for its actual cash value, you're only covering the replacement cost minus the amount the property has depreciated. You receive what the item is worth at the moment of the loss, not what it costs to replace it with something brand new.</p>\n<p>Actual cash value is not the same as <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">market value</a>. Often, your home's market value is much higher than the home's actual cash value because it doesn't take depreciation into account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howisactualcashvaluecalculated\">How is actual cash value calculated?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/replacement-cost-vs-acv/\">ACV coverage can be an attractive option</a> for homeowners in some cases. The premiums are usually lower than those for replacement costs coverage. But it's important to understand how this coverage works so you aren't surprised when it's time to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you insure your home for its actual cash value. Years later, wind damages your roof, which is 12 years old, and the repairs cost $15,000.</p>\n<p>Your insurance provider is not going to pay the full amount to repair the damage. Instead, it will pay out what your roof is worth at the time of the loss. Your provider will likely use this calculation to figure out the years of use left in your roof and its depreciated worth:</p>\n<p><strong>R × (E - C) / E = ACV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>R = replacement cost of the item</strong>\n<strong>E = expected lifespan of the item</strong>\n<strong>C = current life of the item</strong>\n<strong>ACV = actual cash value</strong></p>\n<p>So if your roof has an expected life of 15 years, the actual cash value comes to:</p>\n<p><strong>$15,000 x (15-12) / 15 = $3,000</strong></p>\n<p>It would be your responsibility to come up with the rest of the funds to handle the repair.</p>\n<p>By contrast, if you have replacement cost coverage, only your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> would be subtracted from your payout.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whendoesactualcashvaluecoverageapply\">When does actual cash value coverage apply?</h3>\n<p>Most home insurers use replacement cost coverage for the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">physical structure of your home</a>, but that’s not true for personal property. Providers typically default to actual cash value coverage for the belongings inside your home, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furniture</li>\n<li>Appliances</li>\n<li>Clothing</li>\n<li>Dishes</li>\n<li>Electronics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how insuring for the actual cash value of some items may end up being expensive. Electronics, for instance, depreciate quickly, so your ACV payout from a stolen laptop may not come close to what it costs to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoyouneedactualcashvaluecoverage\">When do you need actual cash value coverage?</h2>\n<p>For some people, insuring property for its actual cash value may make sense. For example, you might go this route if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You’re confident you can make repairs</strong>. DIYers may decide an actual cash value policy is the more affordable option.</li>\n<li><strong>You are comfortable replacing your property with older or used items</strong>. ACV coverage might make sense if you have access to older, affordable replacements.</li>\n<li><strong>Your budget can’t handle higher premiums</strong>. Actual cash value coverage is usually less expensive, so this option may help you save money now at a potential cost to you later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When in doubt, ask us for guidance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoiknowifihaveactualcashvaluecoverage\">How do I know if I have actual cash value coverage?</h3>\n<p>If you bought your policy from Kin, you don’t have actual cash value coverage – we only offer replacement cost insurance. Other home insurance policies may be actual cash value coverage unless they explicitly state otherwise.</p>\n<p>Read your policy closely or review it with your agent to make sure you understand what to expect from your coverage. The information you’re looking for is typically listed under Coverage C (personal property protection).</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanadditionalinsured\">What is an additional insured?</h2>\n<p>An additional insured is a party other than the policyholder who has an interest in whatever is being covered. Homeowners insurance typically covers you and people living in the house who are related to you. That can leave some people exposed.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say your mother leaves you and your brother a house, but only you live in it. You buy <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, so you’re the policyholder and the person who receives the policy’s protections. However, your sister is also an owner and can be sued if someone suffers an accident on the property, and she may lose money if the home is destroyed in a fire. Making her an additional insured on your policy extends its liability coverage to her and gives her the right to file a property claim.</p>\n<p>You might also hear the term additional insured used to describe the actual <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> that extends your insurance coverage to the other party. Endorsements essentially modify your policy. In the case of your homeowners insurance, an additional insured endorsement alters your policy to provide coverage to someone who has a financial stake in your home but isn’t automatically covered. Additional insured endorsements may have a nominal fee associated with them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additionalinsuredvsnamedinsured\">Additional insured vs. named insured</h3>\n<p>You may hear the terms additional insured and named insured when talking to your insurance carrier or someone who wants a certificate of insurance. The named insured is any person or organization specifically designated as insured by a policy. More often than not, the named insured on homeowners insurance is the policyholder, or owner, and has all rights to control the policy. This means the named insured can change coverage or even cancel the policy.</p>\n<p>Because an additional insured doesn’t own the policy, they can’t make any changes to the coverage. They do, however, get the benefits of the policy if a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a> is filed, including having their legal fees covered if they’re named in a lawsuit over events occurring on the insured property. Moreover, additional insureds can file property claims on the insured house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howanadditionalinsuredendorsementworks\">How an additional insured endorsement works</h2>\n<p>To understand how an additional insured endorsement works, let’s first review how the liability coverage in your homeowners insurance. Liability coverage covers claims where someone says you’re responsible for their property damage or bodily injury. For instance, if someone claims your dog bit them or your child broke their window, your policy may cover their medical or repair bills as well as your legal costs if they sue.</p>\n<p>But homeowner insurance only pays these costs for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The named insured.</li>\n<li>Relatives of the named insured.</li>\n<li>People who are younger than 21 years old and under the care of the named insured or another resident of the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that if your significant other moves in and their dog bites a visitor, your partner could be on the hook for the visitor’s injuries. However, getting an additional insured endorsement expands your coverage to include the new party.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whendohomeownersneedanadditionalinsuredendorsement\">When do homeowners need an additional insured endorsement?</h3>\n<p>We’ve mentioned two examples when you might want to get an additional insured endorsement. The first is if you share ownership with someone who doesn’t live on the property, such as siblings inheriting a home but only one choosing to live in it. The second is if someone who isn’t a relative, like a significant other, moves in with you. Similar situations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking a mortgage out on your home.</li>\n<li>Bringing in roommates.</li>\n<li>Sharing ownership with an ex-share.</li>\n<li>Buying a vacation home with another family.</li>\n<li>Selling your home under a long-term contract that allows the purchaser to occupy it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A person or organization typically asks to be an additional insured because they want to protect their interests in the property. Clearly, that’s a benefit for them, but it’s also good for you. Making sure everyone’s financial interests are covered reduces the chance of legal finger-pointing if things go awry.</p>"

Before you experience a loss, spend a little time creating a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a>.

Store these items somewhere secure and accessible during an emergency.</li>\n<li><strong>Review your</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/\"><strong>home insurance</strong></a>. Do this before you experience a loss. Read your policy to see what events are covered, what property is covered, and what your limits are. Most policies also list steps for filing a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a list of questions</strong>. A major loss can be overwhelming. Take a moment to write down the things you want to know before you meet with your claims handler.</li>\n<li><strong>Be honest about the loss</strong>. Overstating the extent of the damage can send up red flags. Be straightforward about your loss so the adjuster can evaluate it fairly.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid altering the condition of your property</strong>. Insurance adjusters need to see the scene as is, so do not clean up or fix your damaged property unless absolutely necessary. If you do have to make repairs, take photos of the property, all of the damages, the cause of loss, the repairs and mitigation process, and keep receipts for the materials you use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You have a better chance of receiving an appropriate settlement when you’ve done your research and can assist the claims adjuster.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanadmittedcarrier\">What is an admitted carrier?</h2>\n<p>Every state has a department of insurance that regulates the industry within the state. One of the jobs of any state’s department of insurance is to license, or admit, carriers. This is why insurance companies that are licensed are often called admitted carriers. To be admitted, carriers have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create insurance policies that comply with state regulations.</li>\n<li>File their insurance forms, or contracts, and premiums with the state’s department of insurance.</li>\n<li>Submit to financial reviews.</li>\n<li>Contribute to the state’s guaranty fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A guaranty fund is simply a way for the state to make sure policyholders are protected if an admitted carrier becomes insolvent. If that happens, the state steps in to pay policyholders’ claims. Essentially, the fund ensures that an insurance carrier’s promise to consumers is fulfilled.</p>\n<p>You can think of the state guarantee fund much like how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures bank deposits. If a bank becomes insolvent, the deposits are protected by the FDIC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanonadmittedcarrier\">What is a non-admitted carrier?</h2>\n<p>Non-admitted carriers, sometimes referred to as <a href=\"/glossary/excess-and-surplus-lines-insurance/\">excess and surplus (E&S) insurance</a> companies, are not licensed in the state where they are selling policies.</p>\n<p>That said, all US-based E&amp;S carriers are licensed in the state where they incorporated, and most need to meet financial requirements to be eligible to provide insurance in the state. E&amp;S carriers generally cover situations that admitted carriers don’t want to cover, such as <a href=\"/blog/high-risk-homeowners-insurance/\">high-risk homes</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"admittedcarriervsnonadmittedcarrier\">Admitted carrier vs. non-admitted carrier</h3>\n<p>The difference between admitted and non-admitted insurance companies is pretty clear: one is licensed by the state and the other is not. However, that doesn’t necessarily make one better than the other. Each has benefits that may be valuable to you depending on your situation.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at admitted insurance companies first. Getting a policy from an admitted carrier means you have recourse if you think your insurer behaved unethically. Plus, you get the comfort of knowing your claim may be covered even if your carrier goes bankrupt. On the other hand, the rules admitted carriers have to follow typically mean they are less flexible. They may not be able to offer you a policy if your home is in a high-risk area or is made with unique materials.</p>\n<p>Non-admitted carriers aren’t bound by the same rules and regulations that admitted insurance carriers are, so they may be able to cover you when admitted carriers can’t. However, that benefit often comes at a price. Admitted carriers generally offer better rates compared to non-admitted carriers who usually charge fees and taxes on top of the premium.</p>\n<p>Non-admitted carriers also don’t have the backing of the state, so you may be on the hook for <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claims</a> in the rare case that your carrier becomes insolvent. But it’s important to note that non-admitted carriers, while facing less regulation, are typically monitored for their financial health.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentouseanadmittedinsurancecompany\">When to use an admitted insurance company</h2>\n<p>Honestly, whether or not you use an admitted carrier may not be up to you. Most states have rules regarding how many times you must be denied by admitted insurance companies before a broker can look for non-admitted insurance. If coverage from an admitted carrier is available, then you most likely need to take it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, admitted carriers can have strict underwriting guidelines. If your home doesn’t fit in those criteria, then it may be difficult to get insurance from an admitted carrier.</p>\n<p>For example, a California homeowner may be denied for standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> because their house sits in a wildfire zone. The laws governing insurance in California say their broker can look for coverage from a non-admitted carrier after three denials. Once the homeowner is denied three times, their broker can contact a surplus lines broker to start looking for an E&amp;S policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gettinginsurancefromadmittedinsurancecompanies\">Getting insurance from admitted insurance companies</h3>\n<p>Chances are that when you call your local insurance agent, they’re going to get a quote from a carrier that is licensed in the state. Most major carriers are admitted in all 50 states, and unless your agent has a license to sell E&amp;S insurance, then admitted carriers are their only option. If these carriers are able to offer you quotes, then you won’t have a chance to look at non-admitted options.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanimalliabilityinsurance\">What is animal liability insurance?</h2>\n<p>You can usually add animal liability insurance to your home insurance policy to cover bodily injuries or property damage your pets cause folks who aren't residents of your home. For example, if your very defensive Pomeranian bites the mailman, this coverage can help pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical expenses related to the injury.</li>\n<li>Legal costs if you are sued over damage the pet caused (up to policy limits).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those costs aren't small, either. The <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-dog-bite-liability\">average dog bite claim costs $50,425</a> as of 2020, according to the Insurance Information Institute.</p>\n<p>If you're a proud pet parent, make sure your home insurance protects your critters, too. Be aware that not all homeowners insurance policies offer animal liability coverage as part of the standard policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howanimalliabilitycoverageworks\">How animal liability coverage works</h3>\n<p>If your homeowners insurance policy provides <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> and <strong>does not</strong> exclude animal liability, your personal liability coverage extends to your pets. Personal liability insurance can cover damages and lawsuits for property damage or bodily injuries you cause another person.</p>\n<p>So if your pet is the one who causes the damage and your policy doesn't exclude animal liability, your homeowners insurance would help pay for medical bills and legal costs if your furry friend hurts a visitor, up to your policy limits.</p>\n<p>However, if your home insurance has an animal liability exclusion, you do not have protection for incidents like dog bites. In this case, you may want to consider purchasing a separate animal liability insurance policy or an animal liability <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> (an add-on to your home insurance policy). This option usually offers $25,000 to $50,000 in animal liability protection.</p>\n<p>Some insurance providers only offer animal liability coverage if your dog is on your property, not off your property. That means any incidents that happen on walks or at the dog park would have to be paid for out of pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatanimalliabilitydoesntcover\">What animal liability doesn't cover</h2>\n<p>Animal liability typically doesn't cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to <strong>your</strong> property caused by your pet.</li>\n<li>Impoundment costs if law enforcement insists that your pet be impounded for a period.</li>\n<li>Vaccination costs if the impounding facility finds that your pet is not up to date on vaccines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Animal liability usually only covers small domestic animals, not \"commercial\" animals (such as ones used for breeding or farm animals).</p>\n<p>Some insurance providers may not offer this coverage for <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">certain breeds of dogs</a>.

    body: "<h2 id=\"aprexplained\">APR explained</h2>\n<p>The annual percentage rate is an important number on any loan because it tells you how much it costs to borrow the money. APRs include not just the interest rate but also all of the additional charges associated with closing the loan. For a mortgage, the additional charges that might be included in the annual percentage rate are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broker fees</li>\n<li>Closing costs</li>\n<li>Rebates</li>\n<li>Discount points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The higher these costs are, the more expensive the loan is, and the higher the APR becomes. APR is common with mortgage loans, credit cards, and personal loans.</p>\n<h2 id=\"annualpercentageratevsinterestrate\">Annual percentage rate vs. interest rate</h2>\n<p>A loan’s annual percentage rate and interest rate are often confused, but it’s very important to know the difference. The interest rate is the straight cost of a loan or <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>. It’s usually lower than the APR because it has no other costs associated with it. The APR adds other costs to the total amount borrowed, and that can give you a more accurate view of what the loan costs.</p>\n<p>This difference is probably most apparent on mortgages where the APR considers closing costs, <a href=\"/blog/mortgage-insurance-vs-home-insurance/\">mortgage insurance</a>, and other fees and so almost always higher than the interest rate. Two mortgages with the same interest rate can have two different APRs. The one with the higher APR is ultimately more expensive because of its extra charges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"calculatingtheapr\">Calculating the APR</h3>\n<p>Let’s look at an example of how to calculate your annual percentage rate to see how the potential fees impact it. The formula to calculate APR is:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/apr1.png\" alt=\"\" />Assume you take out a $1,000 loan over a 180-day loan term. You pay $75 in interest over the life of the loan, and your lender charges a $25 origination fee. When we plug these number into the APR formula it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/apr2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The APR on this loan is 20.28 percent. But what if you find a lender that doesn’t charge any fees? Granted, that would be miraculous, but if you did, the math would like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/apr3.png\" alt=\"\" />Without the $25 fee, the interest rate goes down to 15.21%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagoodannualpercentagerate\">What is a good annual percentage rate?</h2>\n<p>A good APR is one that is as close to the nominal interest rate as possible because that means there are fewer fees driving up the overall cost of the loan. You should also look for any discount points or rebate opportunities because they lower your costs. When points or rebates are added in, you can end up with an APR that’s lower than the interest rate. This, however, is uncommon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whytheannualpercentageratematters\">Why the annual percentage rate matters</h2>\n<p>APR is important because it tells you the real cost of the loan, and that helps you compare offers. You might be misled about the cost of a loan if you only look at the interest rate. Predatory lenders may point to a good interest rate to convince you to take their offer without ever advising you of the additional fees that increases the overall price. This is why legislation now requires lenders to advertise the APR with the interest rate so that borrowers know how much a loan costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtofindloweraprs\">How to find lower APRs</h2>\n<p>Don’t always assume that the advertised APR is always the lowest one available. At the very least, you want to shop around for the lowest APR possible when borrowing money or taking out a credit card. But you may also be able to negotiate fees down, including the closing fees associated with the loan. Talk to each lender about lowering your APR so that you aren’t paying too many fees on top of the loan amount.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanappraisal\">What is an appraisal?</h2>\n<p>An appraisal is a professional assessment of a property’s value. Real estate can be appraised, but so can any other types of property. In the insurance industry, appraisals are used to calculate the cost of replacing the property or to determine the amount of damage to the property after a covered event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenisaninsuranceappraisalnecessary\">When is an insurance appraisal necessary?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners commonly need insurance appraisals in two instances:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you purchase <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>After you experience property loss.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you purchase home insurance, an appraisal helps you determine the value of your home and its contents so you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid being underinsured.</li>\n<li>Pay an appropriate premium.</li>\n<li>Decide if you need additional <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">coverage for your personal property</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your insurer may require an appraisal if your house is old or hasn’t been inspected in a while. You may also want to have your personal property appraised if you have valuable items like expensive jewelry or antiques and want to schedule those items. Scheduling property gives them more protection without drastically increasing your premium.</p>\n<p>You may need an appraisal after your property is damaged by a covered incident, like a fire or windstorm. Once you file a claim, your insurance provider has an adjuster evaluate the damage and offer a settlement based on the appraisal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoestheappraisalprocesswork\">How does the appraisal process work?</h2>\n<p>The appraisal process is essentially the same whether you want one before you buy insurance or after you’ve experienced a loss. A professional appraiser usually comes to your home to conduct the inspection. They evaluate a number of factors, such as the home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Square footage</li>\n<li>Lot size</li>\n<li>Number of bedrooms and baths</li>\n<li>Location</li>\n<li>View</li>\n<li>General condition</li>\n<li>Improvements or renovations</li>\n<li>Contents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The appraiser compares your home to similar homes in the area and use this information to determine your home’s value.</p>\n<p>When an appraiser assesses damage during the claim process, they typically collect additional information, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Witness statements</li>\n<li>Police reports</li>\n<li>Hospital or medical records</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the insurance company approves the claim, the appraiser negotiates the settlement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathappenswhenyoudisagreewithaclaimappraisal\">What happens when you disagree with a claim appraisal</h2>\n<p>As a policyholder, you may be able to dispute the appraiser’s valuation by initiating the appraisal clause. Most policies have this provision to help settle disagreements. It gives you the right to hire a professional appraiser who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conducts their own inspection.</li>\n<li>Assesses your damages.</li>\n<li>Works with the insurer’s appraiser to find an impartial third party (sometimes called an umpire).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, your appraiser may work with the insurance company’s appraiser to come to a reasonable outcome. But when they can’t, they present their finding to the umpire who reviews both appraisals and determines the final settlement.</p>\n<p>Invoking the appraisal clause is often less expensive and less time-consuming than hiring a lawyer and going to court. However, the final outcome is legally binding, and there’s no guarantee it will be any more satisfactory than the initial one. Additionally, the appraisal process can only remedy arguments over the amount of loss. Questions of whether the loss is covered cannot be answered through the appraisal process.</p>"

In some states, the contractor will even file a lawsuit against your insurer as your assignee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownersagreetoanassignmentofbenefits\">Why do homeowners agree to an assignment of benefits?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners may sign an assignment of benefits form because they think it’s more convenient and efficient than dealing with the claims process firsthand.</p>\n<p>Once a contractor has been assigned your benefits, they tell the insurance company what work they believe is required and negotiate the claim. For example, say you have a water leak in the house. You call a home restoration company to stop the water flow, clean up the mess, and restore your home to its former glory. The restoration company may ask for an assignment of benefits so it can deal directly with the insurance company without your input. That may sound like a relief at first glance – someone else can deal with all that!</p>\n<p>But signing away your rights in the claims process may not be worth the risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assignmentofbenefitsinfloridaacaseoframpantfraud\">Assignment of benefits in Florida: a case of rampant fraud</h2>\n<p>Because the assignment of benefits takes control out of the homeowner’s hands, <a href=\"/faq/avoid-contractor-fraud/\">insurance fraud</a> is a major concern. Some contractors may take advantage of the situation and inflate repair needs and costs or bill for work that was never completed. They may also hire attorneys to sue the insurance company if it does not pay the full amount of their estimate or denies claims.</p>\n<p>These lawsuits became a huge problem in Florida – by 2018, there were <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/breaking-news/aob-abuse-in-florida-rises-70-in-15-years-163448.aspx\">135,000 AOB lawsuits</a>, a 70 percent increase in 15 years. On the whole, the FBI estimates fraudulent claims account for nearly <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud\">$6 billion of the $80 billion</a> appropriated for post-hurricane reconstruction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2019/05/24/527402.htm\">Florida eventually passed a bill</a> in 2019 to curb the abuse of assignment of benefits.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">AOB fraud</a> hurts homeowners the most. It increases homeowners insurance rates across the board, and you may be stuck with incomplete work and no recourse.</p>\n<p>That’s why we offer a <a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair discount</a> for homeowners who retain their rights during a claim. It’s about a 5 percent discount on average to reward you for proactively protecting yourself and preventing fraud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatresponsibilitiesdoestheaobcontractorhave\">What responsibilities does the AOB contractor have?</h2>\n<p>Once you sign an AOB, a contractor has full power to make all decisions about the claim without consulting you. The assignment of benefits gives contractors the ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">File the insurance claim</a>.</li>\n<li>Work directly with insurance claims adjusters.</li>\n<li>Make repair decisions.</li>\n<li>Complete repairs.</li>\n<li>Directly bill the insurance carrier for all work completed.</li>\n<li>Sue your insurance company regarding your claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes the assignment of benefits limits the scope to the work the contractor was hired for. For example, say your home has a leaky pipe. You may hire a plumber to fix the leak, a remediation company to dry the walls and carpet, and a general contractor to replace the bathroom cabinets. Each of the three contractors may have a respective assignment of benefits for their part of the job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howassignmentofbenefitsimpactshomeowners\">How assignment of benefits impacts homeowners</h2>\n<p>Under some circumstances, an assignment of benefits agreement could work out for homeowners who don’t want to handle their insurance claim. If the contractor is reputable, performs the work, and knows what information the insurance company needs, it can be a big help.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The claims adjuster will work directly with the contractor.</li>\n<li>The contractor would handle remediation and repairs.</li>\n<li>The contractor would bill the insurance company, not the homeowner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AOB arrangements only work for covered damage in need of repair. If you must replace belongings or appliances, you’d still need to work directly with your insurer and payments would go to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protectingyourselfinanassignmentofbenefitsagreement\">Protecting yourself in an assignment of benefits agreement</h2>\n<p>Don’t sign an assignment of benefits agreement right off the bat. Before you hire any contractor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get multiple quotes.</li>\n<li>Check references, licenses, and their insurance.</li>\n<li>Get written estimates for potential work.</li>\n<li>Get a guarantee to back the workmanship.</li>\n<li>Make sure you get to approve completed work.</li>\n<li>Request copies of all paperwork sent to your insurance company.</li>\n<li>Require that the contractor show you the documents you are actually signing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be tempted to hire the first contractor you find, but you save yourself headaches if you do some due diligence before signing an assignment of benefits.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaballoonpayment\">What is a balloon payment?</h2>\n<p>A balloon payment is a large sum due as the final installment on a loan that’s higher than any other scheduled payment. By definition, balloon payments only need to be double what the regular monthly payment is, but they can be significantly higher. Balloon payments on <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgages</a> can lead to a final installment of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendopeoplegetballoonloans\">When do people get balloon loans?</h2>\n<p>As we already mentioned, people can also get mortgages with balloon payments. However, balloon payments are much more common in business, particularly when a business owner needs short-term financing. People may also choose a car loan with a balloon payment.</p>\n<p>Borrowers may opt for a loan with a balloon payment because they want to pay lower installments throughout the life of the loan. This is riskier than choosing other types of installment loans because you can’t know if you’ll have enough cash available to pay it off. In fact, most people who take out loans with balloon payments plan to refinance before the final installment is due.</p>\n<h2 id=\"balloonmortgages\">Balloon mortgages</h2>\n<p>There are several types of balloon mortgages. Some are interest-only mortgages where the entire balance is due in a lump sum at the end of the term, but others let you pay the interest and balance so your balloon payment is slightly less.</p>\n<p>Balloon mortgages can be very attractive if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re working on improving your credit score.</li>\n<li>You plan to be in the house for only a few years.</li>\n<li>You need to build equity before you refinance.</li>\n<li>You have a high net worth and know you can pay off the balance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While paying a lower bill every month may seem like a good idea, you need to remember that balloon payments don’t lower your overall costs. That’s why balloon mortgages are probably best for people who know they will have the capital to pay off their loan at the end of the term. It’s also why banks generally only offer balloon mortgages to people with very large incomes. Anyone else usually needs to <a href=\"/blog/refinancing-your-mortgage/\">refinance the loan</a> prior to the end of their loan’s term.</p>\n<h2 id=\"balloonpaymentexample\">Balloon payment example</h2>\n<p>Let’s assume you take out a $300,000 mortgage at 3% interest for a 10-year term that pays both principal and interest. At this rate, your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly payment is $1,264.81.</li>\n<li>Balloon payment is $229,324.56.</li>\n<li>Total cost for the mortgage is $379,837</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the 10 years, you either have to pay $229,324.56 so you own the house free and clear, or you need to refinance your home to pay the balloon payment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prosandconsofloanswithballoonpayments\">Pros and cons of loans with balloon payments</h2>\n<p>People who are <a href=\"/blog/how-to-afford-a-house/\">trying to afford a house</a> need to understand the pros and cons of a balloon mortgage.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, balloon payments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer lower monthly payments, making the loan more affordable.</li>\n<li>Help you save interest on the balance due.</li>\n<li>Can cover gaps in financing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, they also come with some disadvantages. For example, a balloon payment may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase your chances of defaulting on the loan if lenders won’t refinance when the balloon payment is due.</li>\n<li>Leave you stuck in home if you can’t sell it to meet the demand of the balloon payment.</li>\n<li>Require refinance when interest rates are higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some homebuyers may find that their situation makes balloon mortgages a good bet, but they are few and far between. Before you sign up for any loan with a balloon payment, make sure you understand the risks.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisbasefloodelevation\">What is base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p><strong>BFE, meaning</strong> base flood elevation, is the level of surface water anticipated to reach during a base flood. “Base flood” refers to a flood that has a 1% chance of being either equaled or exceeded in a given area in a given year.</p>\n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps base flood elevations for several <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">AE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">AH</a></li>\n<li>A1–A30</li>\n<li>AR</li>\n<li>AR/<a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">A</a></li>\n<li>AR/AE</li>\n<li>AR/A1– A30</li>\n<li>AR/AH, AR/<a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">AO</a></li>\n<li>V1–V30</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">VE</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>FEMA also designates these flood zones as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs). Other flood zones that start with either an A or a V are also SFHAs, but they don’t have base flood elevations. Property owners in SFHAs have to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Base flood elevations are represented on <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">FEMA maps</a> below the flood zone as EL plus a number (i.e., EL 14). This number represents the expected height rounded to the nearest foot, so EL 14 represents a base flood elevation of approximately 14 feet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howisabasefloodelevationused\">How is a base flood elevation used?</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies compare base flood elevations to the lowest floor of a structure to try and anticipate its chances for experiencing flood damage. This is important for determining flood insurance premiums. If a home’s lowest level is above the area’s BFE, then floodwaters are less likely to reach it, and the insurer can charge a lower rate.</p>\n<p>Homeowners and builders can also use BFEs when building or renovating a home. Once you have your property’s base flood elevation, you determine where the lowest level of the house should be. All of your livable space should be above the BFE, and you may also want to place electrical, heating, air conditioning, and plumbing systems above your base flood elevation to reduce damage during a 100-year flood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesabasefloodelevationrequirefloodinsurance\">Does a base flood elevation require flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>All flood zones with base flood elevations are also named as Special Flood Hazard Areas with a significant risk for flood. One important requirement that comes into play because of the designation is that federally backed or regulated mortgage lenders can only loan money to people with flood insurance. Lenders are particularly stringent about meeting flood insurance if they provide loans from the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal Housing Administration.</li>\n<li>US Department of Veteran Affairs.</li>\n<li>US Department of Agriculture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don’t have flood insurance and are required to, your lender may purchase a policy on your behalf and bill it through your escrow account.</p>\n<p>Even if you aren’t required to maintain flood insurance, you may want to get a policy if you’re in a flood zone. Climate change has caused more frequent and bigger natural disasters and more homes are at risk. Moreover, an <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/calculator\">inch of water</a> can cause more than $25,000 in property damage. Without flood insurance, you’re left to pay for all losses on your own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforhomeswithabasefloodelevation\">Tips for homes with a base flood elevation</h2>\n<p>If you live in a flood zone with a base flood elevation, you may want to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">reduce your flood risk</a> and its subsequent damage. Risk mitigation is a good way to keep your insurance premiums from going up. A few ways you can do this is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your home is built with all usable spaces above your BFE.</li>\n<li>Review <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/pdf/floodplain/nfip_sg_unit_5.pdf\">other regulations</a>, such whether you can elevate your home with fill, columns, or crawl spaces.</li>\n<li>Landscape your property so the slope goes away from your house.</li>\n<li>Raise all water-sensitive equipment above the base flood elevation.</li>\n<li>Install a backflow valve to prevent water damage from sewer backup.</li>\n<li>Clean rain spouts and keep them positioned so water moves away from your house.</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisbodilyinjury\">What is bodily injury?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes called physical injury, bodily injury is physical damage caused to a person’s body. Types of bodily injury include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fractures.</li>\n<li>Abrasions.</li>\n<li>Bruises.</li>\n<li>Illness.</li>\n<li>Disease.</li>\n<li>Cuts.</li>\n<li>Disfigurement.</li>\n<li>Impairment of function.</li>\n<li>Internal bleeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatisbodilyinjuryliability\">What is bodily injury liability?</h2>\n<p>Bodily injury liability is when you’re responsible for a third party’s physical injury. Most people are familiar with the term because of their auto insurance. Most states require auto owners to carry bodily injury liability coverage to pay for other people’s injuries, lost wages, and even funeral expenses if they are at fault in an auto accident.</p>\n<p>The coverage in your homeowners' insurance works very similarly. While not required by law, most standard policies include <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> (Coverage E). This means homeowners don’t have to worry about the costs of third-party claims that the homeowner or their family members are responsible for someone else’s injuries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesbodilyinjuryliabilitycover\">What does bodily injury liability cover?</h2>\n<p>The bodily injury liability coverage in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a> helps pay the costs associated with accidental injuries to other parties, such as the injured party’s</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical expenses, such as emergency room visits and hospital stays.</li>\n<li>Lost wages if the injury keeps the person from working.</li>\n<li>Pain and suffering if awarded by the court.</li>\n<li>Death benefits to cover funeral costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re found liable for another person’s bodily injury, your coverage helps with these expenses whether the injury took place on your property or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bodilyinjurycoverageexamples\">Bodily injury coverage examples</h2>\n<p>Your personal liability coverage kicks in for bodily injury in both common and unusual circumstances. However, one of the key components is the idea of negligence. The injured party usually has to show that you somehow failed to meet a standard of reasonable care﹘essentially, what any sensible person would do to reduce the likelihood of accidents.</p>\n<p>Below are a few examples of how Coverage E protects you in bodily injury claims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"accidentalslipandfalls\">Accidental slip-and-falls</h3>\n<p>Let’s say a neighbor decides to stop by for a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, they slip on the icy walk leading up to your house and break their hip. The injury leads to an ER visit, surgery, and rehabilitation, so your neighbor sues to recoup these costs. This triggers the personal injury coverage in your home insurance policy because you still have to defend yourself whether or not you were actually negligent. And if your neighbor show you were negligent﹘because, say, you took too long to remove the ice﹘then your policy may cover the court-awarded settlement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dogbites\">Dog bites</h3>\n<p>In this scenario, you have a dog that bites someone. States laws often make you liable for your dog’s actions regardless of what led up to the incident. Some, however, place the responsibility for the bite on you in certain situations, like if you knew the dog was aggressive or were supposed to keep it on a leash.</p>\n<p>Coverage E can pay for the victim’s medical bills if your state’s laws make you liable for the bite. However, some carriers exclude dog bites, so you may need an <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"injuredburglars\">Injured burglars</h3>\n<p>You read that headline correctly. It’s bad enough when someone breaks into your home to steal from you, but what happens if the burglar gets injured while on your property? Technically, the burglar can sue﹘in which case, your home insurance would cover your defense﹘ but their chance of winning is low.</p>\n<p>While homeowners are expected to maintain a safe property, they generally only owe a duty of care to people they either invite in or grant permissions to. Burglars, however, are trespassers and homeowners have no obligation to protect trespassers except if they know there are trespassers on their property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatbodilyinjurydoesnotcover\">What bodily injury does not cover</h2>\n<p>Personal liability covers most injuries that people suffer due to your actions. However, the incident needs to be accidental. If you intentionally hurt someone, your insurance may not pay the claims. For example, your insurance carrier will most likely deny a claim that involves you punching someone. If the person you punched sues for their bodily injuries, you will have to pay for them out of your own pocket.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatiscatastrophiccoverage\">What is catastrophic coverage?</h2>\n<p>Catastrophic coverage pays for damage caused by low-probability, high-cost events, such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. You can buy catastrophic coverage as a standalone policy, but some providers offer coverage for specific perils you can add as endorsements to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areyouatriskforacatastrophe\">Are you at risk for a catastrophe?</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by defining catastrophe. In the insurance world, a catastrophe is a natural or human-created disaster that impacts many policyholders and providers at the same time and where claims are expected to reach a specific dollar amount. These events may not happen very often, but they cause considerable damage when they do. As a result, many standard home insurance policies exclude coverage for these catastrophes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Floods</a></li>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n<li>Hurricanes</li>\n<li>Tornadoes</li>\n<li>Tsunamis</li>\n<li>Wildfires</li>\n<li>Volcanos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That coverage gap may be bad news if you live near:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A floodplain</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Hurricane Alley or Tornado Alley</a></li>\n<li>The coast</li>\n<li>A wildfire zone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your geography can increase your risk of facing a catastrophe. And that means you could find yourself without coverage at the moment you need it most.</p>\n<p>But you don’t have to move or risk losing your home when disaster strikes. Many insurance providers offer catastrophic coverage, either as standalone policies or endorsements you can add to your home insurance. You can even buy catastrophic coverage for the peril you are most likely to face in your area.</p>\n<p>For instance, floods are a bigger problem than most homeowners realize. <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1499290622913-0bcd74f47bf20aa94998a5a920837710/Flood_Loss_Estimations_2017.pdf\">FEMA estimates</a> that just an inch of water can cause $23,635 in damage to just the home. The increasing likelihood of floods and cost of flood loss makes flood insurance a smart move for most homeowners.</p>\n<p>Even if you think your home is in the clear, your mortgage lender may not. It may require catastrophic coverage to protect the investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoescatastrophiccoveragecost\">How much does catastrophic coverage cost?</h2>\n<p>Costs for catastrophic coverage vary by insurer and area. In general, the greater the risk, the higher the cost. Take Florida, for example. Areas along the coast have a high risk for hurricane, flood, and earth movement, so the cost is probably higher than a landlocked area in the Midwest.</p>\n<p>Certain locations may also have to deal with special deductibles, like Texas’s <a href=\"/glossary/designated-catastrophe-area/\">designated catastrophe area</a>. Hurricane risk is high for the 14 counties in this area, so homeowners usually have a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> on top of the standard flat deductible. Depending on where your home is, a hurricane deductible can be as much as 10% of your home’s insured value.</p>\n<p>To keep costs down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shop around.</strong> Different insurance providers may offer better rates. Get quotes from a few companies before you decide.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for other discounts.</strong> Ask your agents about discounts on your home insurance. You may see lower premiums for security systems, fire alarms, smoke detectors, and wind mitigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not sure if your home needs catastrophic coverage?

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatiscatastrophicgroundcovercollapsecoverage\">What is catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage?</h2>\n<p>Catastrophic ground cover collapse (CGCC) is a severe form of sinkhole loss when layers under the ground’s surface abruptly collapse, cause a visible depression in the ground, and make a home uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>Catastrophic ground cover collapse insurance kicks in when all these conditions are met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ground cover abruptly collapsed.</li>\n<li>A depression in the ground cover is clearly visible to the naked eye.</li>\n<li>There’s structural damage to the home and its foundation.</li>\n<li>A government agency condemns the home and orders it to be vacated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">home insurance in Florida</a> is required to include catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage. It offers key protection when your home faces extreme sinkhole damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catastrophicgroundcollapsecoveragevssinkholeinsurance\">Catastrophic ground collapse coverage vs. sinkhole insurance</h2>\n<p>Catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage is way more restrictive than sinkhole coverage. As we mentioned above, all four conditions must be met before your coverage can help out. Your home has to be so devastated by a visible depression in the ground that it’s legally uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole insurance</a> can cover smaller damages caused by sinkholes, like cracks in the foundation and buckling floors or walls. Your home can still be inhabitable and this coverage will still kick in.</p>\n<p>Neither type of coverage pays for sinkhole damage to driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, patio decks, or open land.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iscatastrophicgroundcovercollapsecoveredbyhomeownersinsurance\">Is catastrophic ground cover collapse covered by homeowners insurance?</h2>\n<p>Yes, catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage is included in your standard Florida homeowners insurance policy. Sinkhole insurance is not, but we can easily add it on for extra protection if you’re in an area prone to minor sinkhole activity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"signsofcatastrophicgroundcovercollapse\">Signs of catastrophic ground cover collapse</h2>\n<p>Sinkholes happen without warning, and the severity varies. You may suddenly see a hole in your front yard. You may see small cracks in the floor or ceiling – a sign that the foundation might’ve moved and strained the structure of the home. Or you might notice water pooling in an area that was previously draining properly. These could be signs that layers under the surface of the ground are moving and eroding – it could lead to a big hole in the future.</p>\n<p>Here are other signs that a sinkhole may be growing under your home:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Floor displacement.</li>\n<li>Foundation un-leveling and displacement.</li>\n<li>Buckling walls.</li>\n<li>Ground depressions.</li>\n<li>Cracks in the wall and ceiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learning the early signs of a sinkhole can help you take action before the damage gets out of hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoaftercatastrophicgroundcovercollapse\">What to do after catastrophic ground cover collapse</h2>\n<p>If your home has damage from catastrophic ground cover collapse, there’s almost no mistaking it. To meet this threshold, the hole in the ground must have collapsed abruptly and be clearly visible. There also has to be structural damage to your property to the extent that authorities order you to vacate it.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do if you experience this type of loss is to get yourself, your family, and pets to safety. Then you need to call your insurance company to <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">begin the claims process</a>. If you're a Kin member, we’ll consult a professional engineer or geologist to confirm the damage was caused by catastrophic ground cover collapse and to prepare a report for your claim.</p>\n<p>Remember that CGCC losses are unpredictable, so you don’t want to be stuck in the house when the floor collapses out from under you.</p>\n<p>In the event of a catastrophic ground cover collapse claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evacuate immediately.</li>\n<li>Remove personal items at risk if you can do so safely.</li>\n<li>File a claim with your insurance company.</li>\n<li>Notify the city or county building inspector.</li>\n<li>Tape or rope off the area for safety (if you’re able).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t enter the area because the ground is unstable and dangerous.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areaspronetocatastrophicgroundcovercollapse\">Areas prone to catastrophic ground cover collapse</h2>\n<p>Sinkholes tend to form in regions with limestone deposits and underground water supplies. These <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/sinkholes-and-insurance\">states have the highest sinkhole risk</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Florida</li>\n<li>Texas</li>\n<li>Alabama</li>\n<li>Missouri</li>\n<li>Kentucky</li>\n<li>Tennessee</li>\n<li>Pennsylvania</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Geologists predict these areas have a one-in-100 chance of a catastrophic sinkhole occurrence in a year. Sinkhole activity is highest after a storm with significant <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flooding</a> that doesn’t drain.</p>\n<p>There may not be much you can do to prevent a sinkhole, but you can make sure that you have the right coverage to protect yourself.</p>"

This is where you'll find instructions for making a claim. Policies and providers may have different requirements, but most want you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promptly report claims to your provider or agent.</li>\n<li>Provide information, like your name, policy number, and details about the loss.</li>\n<li>Give the names of any witness or people who may have a claim against you.</li>\n<li>Send documents, invoices, receipts, and pleadings associated with the loss, like police reports.</li>\n<li>Assist with the investigation and/or lawsuit.</li>\n<li>Authorize them to review medical records and reports if someone is injured.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prompt reporting of a loss is essential. Depending on the situation, a delay may mean your insurance company might deny your claim, leaving you on the hook for repairs, medical bills, and lawsuits.</p>\n<p>Once you alert your insurance company about the claim, it will most likely send you claims forms. By law, you have to return them to your provider’s claims department within a certain number of days. Review these and fill them out carefully to avoid delayed claim payments if your loss is covered.</p>\n<p>Your insurance provider might also send an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">insurance adjuster</a>. This person investigates your loss and, if your loss is covered, might offer you a settlement for repairs based on your policy terms and coverage limits. For example, your settlement offer may take into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your deductible.</strong> This amount is deducted from your claim payout.</li>\n<li><strong>The type of coverage you chose when you purchased your policy.</strong> Opting for <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value (ACV)</a> coverage means your insurance covers the depreciated value of your property. A replacement cost policy pays out more, covering what it costs to replace your property with a new item of similar quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Your mortgage lender.</strong> Most policies require your lenders to be included on payment for buildings. That means claim payments will include both you and your lender as payees. Condo owners, your management company may have similar requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your adjuster may pay your claim the day they investigate. Even if you accept that settlement, you can still reopen your claim if you find additional damage. Most policies give you a year after the loss event to file, but ask your representative or review your policy to be sure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4tipsforfilinganinsuranceclaim\">4 tips for filing an insurance claim</h2>\n<p>Filing a claim can be daunting if you don’t know what to expect. These tips may help make the claims process easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Ideally, you’d never have to make a claim, but be prepared in case you do. Create a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> that includes serial numbers, important receipts, and <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisals</a>. Keep this and a copy of your insurance policy in a fireproof safe.</li>\n<li><strong>Talk to your insurance representative.</strong> You already know you need to report a claim quickly. However, your agent can also help you decide if you want to file a claim. Claims can make your premium go up, and multiple claims can make insurers think twice about offering coverage. However, please note that most policies require you to provide notice to your insurer if you have a claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Only make necessary repairs.</strong> You want the adjuster to see the damage as it is. If you have to make repairs to keep people safe or to stop additional problems, be sure to take pictures or video first and report it to your insurer.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your receipts.</strong> If you spend money on temporary repairs or housing, hold on to your receipts. Your policy may cover them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preparing for trouble helps you get back to your life faster.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatareclosingcosts\">What are closing costs?</h2>\n<p>Most homebuyers end up paying additional fees required at the end of the transaction called closing costs. Closing costs are due when transferring the title from a seller to a buyer and are necessary to close the deal. They can include charges for appraisals, prepaid property taxes, and loan origination fees.</p>\n<p>Both buyers and sellers can be subject to closing costs, but buyers usually have more closing costs than sellers. Mortgage lenders must include these additional costs in their loan estimates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchareclosingcosts\">How much are closing costs?</h2>\n<p>First-time homeowners are rarely familiar with closing costs, so the price tag can be a bit of a surprise. The fees range anywhere from 2% and 5% of the purchase price, and the average homeowner pays $5,749 in closing costs when you include taxes. This varies depending on where you live and the type of home you purchase. At $25,800, the District of Columbia has the highest average closing cost if you include taxes. The lowest average with taxes is Indiana at $1,909.</p>\n<p>Note, too, the percentage estimate for closing costs is based on the purchase price, not the loan value. Mortgage lenders don’t always cover the entire cost of your home, so these amounts are often different.</p>\n<p>That said, some closing costs can be rolled into your loan. For example, let’s say you want to buy a $200,000 home using a $190,000 loan, and your closing costs are 3% of the purchase price. That means you’re going to pay $6,000 at closing. If your lender allows you to finance your mortgage closing costs, then your final loan amount is $196,000.</p>\n<p>Adding your closing costs to your mortgage can seem like a good idea, but you should remember that you still have to pay the money back. Plus, you’ll have to pay interest on the money borrowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofclosingcosts\">Types of closing costs</h2>\n<p>We’ve counted nearly 20 different types of closing costs that the typical homebuyer may run into, and grouped them by which aspect of the transaction they relate to. You should note, however, that this is not a complete list. Depending on your situation, you may see other mortgage closing costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propertyrelatedfees\">Property-Related Fees</h3>\n<p>Property-related fees are costs directly tied to buying the property. These will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appraisal fee:</strong> This is a report that gives an estimate of what the value of the home is based on market conditions. The appraisal could be higher or lower than the selling price.</li>\n<li><strong>Home inspection fee:</strong> Buyers need to know if there are any problems with the property, and that usually requires hiring a home inspector. Home inspections are required for many government-backed mortgages such as an FHA loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"loanrelatedfees\">Loan-related fees</h3>\n<p>Loan-related fees are costs associated with originating and closing the loan. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Application fee.</strong> Lenders often charge this fee to cover the cost of processing your loan, including paying for a credit check.</li>\n<li><strong>Assumption fee.</strong> This fee is only charged when the seller has an assumable mortgage, and it’s based on the balance of that mortgage.</li>\n<li><strong>Prepaid interest.</strong> Lenders usually require buyers to prepay the interest that will accrue between your closing date and your first mortgage payment.</li>\n<li><strong>Loan origination fee.</strong> This is sometimes called an underwriting or processing fee, and it covers the cost of preparing your mortgage. Whatever it’s called, it’s approximately 0.5% of the loan value.</li>\n<li><strong>Discount points.</strong> You can elect to pay discount points that reduce the interest rate on the loan. One point is 1% of the loan amount.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage broker fees.</strong> Those who work with mortgage brokers typically pay a commission that ranges from 0.5% to 2.75% of the home’s purchase price.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mortgageinsurancefees\">Mortgage insurance fees</h3>\n<p>Lenders may require you to get <a href=\"/glossary/private-mortgage-insurance/\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI), especially if you put down less than 20% on your home, and it usually comes with some extra fees, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortgage insurance application fee.</strong> This fee covers the cost of processing your PMI application.</li>\n<li><strong>Upfront mortgage insurance.</strong> You may be asked to pay your first year’s mortgage insurance premium at the time of closing. This can range anywhere from 0.55% to 2.25% of the loan. A Federal Housing Administration loan works a little differently.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisacoinsuranceclause\">What is a coinsurance clause?</h2>\n<p>A coinsurance clause is a provision in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> that requires you to carry coverage worth a certain percentage of your home’s value. Failure to meet the requirement reduces your compensation after a loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoescoinsurancework\">How does coinsurance work?</h2>\n<p>Most home insurance policies include a coinsurance clause to encourage policyholders to carry the appropriate amount of coverage. The clause does this by requiring you to insure your home for a percentage of either its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> or its replacement cost value. Basically, the coinsurance clause prevents you from underinsuring your home.</p>\n<p>If you don’t insure your property at the specified percentage, typically at least 80% of its value, you can face a coinsurance penalty. Your losses are still covered but only for percentage of what you might expect.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example: Say your home’s replacement cost value is $200,000, and your coinsurance requirement is 80%. You need to insure your home for at least $160,000 to avoid the penalty.</p>\n<p>Please note: Insuring your home for $160,000 satisfies the coinsurance clause, but it may leave you short when you need to replace your property. Even though your replacement cost is $200,000, the most your insurance provider might pay is $160,000 for a total loss. And that doesn’t take your deductible into consideration.</p>\n<p>But now let’s say you want to save money and decide to insure your $200,000 home for only $100,000. When you file a claim, your insurer will realize your coverage falls short of the requirement and use a formula to determine your penalty. The penalty amount is deducted from your claim settlement.</p>\n<p>The same is true if you choose to insure your home for its actual cash value and fail to secure sufficient coverage. But in that case, your insurance provider also deducts your property’s depreciation from your reimbursement.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the trickiest part of the coinsurance clause is the valuation. Your home’s value can change due to inflation and home improvements, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finishing your basement.</li>\n<li>Upgrading your electrical.</li>\n<li>Replacing your windows.</li>\n<li>Landscaping your yard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A change in your home’s value can mean you fall short of the coinsurance clause requirements. On the other hand, depreciation may mean you’re paying too much for your insurance, so be sure to get your home appraised semi-regularly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcaniavoidacoinsurancepenalty\">How can I avoid a coinsurance penalty?</h2>\n<p>A coinsurance penalty can be an unpleasant surprise when you’re trying to recover from a loss. However, you can avoid it. Here’s how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find out what your coinsurance clause is.</strong> You can usually find this information in the \"conditions\" section of your policy under the heading Loss Settlement.</li>\n<li><strong>Determine the value of your house on a regular basis.</strong> Get an <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> once every three years.</li>\n<li><strong>Set your insurance limits appropriately.</strong> Take the information you’ve gathered and review it with an agent. They can help you fulfill the coinsurance clause requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staying on top of your policy is an important part of owning a home.

    body: "<h2 id=\"dateofissuevseffectivedate\">Date of issue vs. effective date</h2>\n<p>There are two critical dates to understand on an insurance policy: the date of issue and the effective date. The date of issue, sometimes called the issue date, is the day that the insurance carrier agrees to provide you coverage and issues your policy. This can be on or before the effective date, but never after because the effective date is the day that the coverage actually begins.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the issue date indicates a contract has been created and sent to the parties involved, but it isn’t necessarily providing the benefits of coverage. The <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a>, however, tells you that your insurance company is protecting your home and belongings ﹘ and that your responsibilities to the insurer, like paying premiums, have begun as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyourdateofissuematters\">Why your date of issue matters</h2>\n<p>This may be surprising, but sometimes you need an insurance policy before you need the actual coverage. One of the most common instances of this is when you want to buy or rent a home, but it can also happen when someone needs to buy a car or lease commercial property. These types of contracts often require proof of insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dateofissueexample\">Date of issue example</h3>\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example to better understand the date of issue's meaning. Imagine you’re in the process of buying a home, and your lender asks for proof that you have <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> before they’ll sign off on your <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a>. Escrow is set to close on August 10, but your lender needs proof of insurance by August 1 to get your loan processed and ready in time.</p>\n<p>However, you don’t want to insure a property that you don’t own, so you need the policy contract to be issued by August 1 but the coverage to begin on August 10. August 1 is the policy’s date of issue while August 10 is its effective date.</p>\n<p>You should also note that you can change your policy’s effective date if you need to. For instance, you may need to push it back if there’s some sort of delay when you’re buying a house. The date of issue, however, does not change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cancelingyourpolicyafterthedateofissue\">Canceling your policy after the date of issue</h3>\n<p>What happens if you change your mind after your home insurance policy has been issued? Say the seller changes their mind or you get cold feet and you decide you don’t need the policy? You can cancel a policy prior to the effective date and get a full refund. Insurance companies can’t charge you for coverage that you never actually had.</p>\n<h2 id=\"locatingyourpolicysdateofissue\">Locating your policy's date of issue</h2>\n<p>Both the date of issue and the effective date are items found on the your <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. The declarations page is a one or two page summary of your policy, including your name, the address of the property, the policy’s issue and effective date, and the limits on the various coverages provided by the policy.</p>\n<p>Every insurance carrier formats the declarations page slightly differently, so where the date of issue is may vary. However, it is normally located near the top by your name.</p>\n<p>When reviewing the declarations page, it’s a good idea to review all personal details to make sure there are no typos with your name or address. Also, confirm that the coverages are what you had discussed with your insurance representative. Doing so before the effective date minimizes the chance of any problems with coverage once the policy is in effect.</p>"

It’s usually the first page or two of your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatinformationisinadeclarationspage\">What information is in a declarations page?</h2>\n<p>You may have heard your insurance agent refer to the dec or dec page of your homeowners insurance policy.

For one, insurance policies are long and full of legalese. Your dec page puts all of the most useful information front and center. You don't have to dig through a thick contract just to find your limit for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments</a> or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a> when it’s time to make a claim.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you can skip reading your policy in its entirety. You still want to know the details of what’s covered and what’s excluded. However, the declarations page can be a big help when you need information fast.</p>\n<p>You may also need your declarations page when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You're switching insurance companies.</strong> New insurers will want proof of continuous coverage, which may qualify you for a discount. Some insurance providers won't insure homes that don't have previous coverage (with the exception of new homes).</li>\n<li><strong>Your mortgage lender needs proof of insurance.</strong> Many mortgage companies want a copy of the dec page every year to make sure your home is adequately insured. Failure to keep your insurance may give your lender the right to place insurance on your behalf. A <a href=\"/glossary/force-placed-insurance/\">lender-placed policy</a> is usually more expensive than home insurance you buy on your own. Plus, the lender may add the premium to your mortgage payments.</li>\n<li><strong>You want to compare insurance policies.</strong> A declarations page is an easy way to make an apples-to-apples comparison when shopping for new coverage. You can compare your quote to your current policy's coverage and limits as seen on the declarations page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtocheckyourdeclarationspage\">How to check your declarations page</h2>\n<p>If you're a Kin customer, you can find your declarations page in your online portal. For those of you who haven't joined us yet, you can find your declarations page in your policy –&nbsp;it's usually the first page of it.</p>\n<p>You should review your declarations page when you first receive it and again whenever you change your home insurance. Here are a few things to check for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Names are correctly spelled.</li>\n<li>The address is correct.</li>\n<li>The limits, deductibles, and premiums are what you expect.</li>\n<li>Your discounts have been applied.</li>\n<li>You’ve received the correct coverage.</li>\n<li>Your endorsements are included.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mistakes on the declarations pages don’t necessarily mean you have the wrong coverage, but it’s better to correct them before they become a problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisntincludedonyourdeclarationspage\">What isn’t included on your declarations page</h2>\n<p>There are a number of important details that you may not find on the dec page, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Covered perils</li>\n<li>Excluded property</li>\n<li>Some optional coverages, like identity theft insurance</li>\n<li>Your duties and obligations when filing a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, some homeowners confuse the declarations page with two other important documents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insurance bill.</strong> Considering the dec page lists their premium, it’s an easy mistake to make. However, your provider will send you a separate bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Insurance binder.</strong> Your binder has much of the same information as the dec page, so it can be used as evidence of insurance. However, a binder is a temporary document. Once the binder expires, it does not prove you have coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, if you have questions about your policy or your coverage, talk to your insurance representative.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisdepreciation\">What is depreciation?</h2>\n<p>Depreciation is the loss in value most property undergoes as it ages or experiences normal wear and tear. Items that depreciate have a specific length of time that they are considered useful. When these items are new, they have 100% of their value, but then depreciate to 0% of their value once they have reached the end of their useful age.</p>\n<p>Methods for calculating depreciation can vary by insurance provider. One way to determine depreciation is to divide the cost of an asset, minus its salvage value, over its useful life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesdepreciationaffectyourhomeinsurance\">How does depreciation affect Your home insurance?</h2>\n<p>When you buy <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, you need to decide if you want to insure your property for its replacement cost value (RCV) or its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value (ACV)</a>. Choosing a replacement cost policy means your insurance provider reimburses you the amount it would cost to replace your damaged items with new, similar items. An actual cash value policy only pays the depreciated value.</p>\n<p>Each insurance provider has its own way of determining depreciation, some even use the IRS depreciation guidelines. However, most consider an item’s replacement cost value and its life expectancy, or how long the owner should expect to get use out of the property. Each year that passes, the item loses a percentage of its value.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example that may make this clearer: Let’s say you buy a laptop for $1,000, and you have actual cash value coverage for it. It is assumed to have a life expectancy of five years. That means every year, the laptop loses 20% of its value. If it’s stolen after only a year, your laptop’s depreciated value is $800.</p>\n<p>Remember, certain items don’t depreciate, like fine art, jewelry, and antiques. Some, like cars and computers, depreciate faster than others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"depreciationandclaims\">Depreciation and claims</h2>\n<p>Depreciation is also important to understand when it’s time to file a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a>. Even if your home insurance is written on a replacement cost basis, under most policies you initially receive the actual cash value of the damaged item. To get the rest of the payout, you typically need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay to repair or replace the item.</li>\n<li>Submit invoices, signed contracts, receipts, or cancelled checks to your insurer.</li>\n<li>Complete any paperwork required by your insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind your insurance company usually pays the difference between the actual cash value and what it cost you to replace the item. For example, let’s say you spend $900 to replace the stolen laptop. Your insurer has already covered the actual cash value of $800, so the recoverable depreciation is the remaining $100.</p>"

It includes 14 counties and a portion of Harris County where homeowners face a greater risk of hail and windstorm damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattexascountiesareinthedesignatedcatastrophearea\">What Texas counties are in the designated catastrophe area?</h2>\n<p>The first thing you need to know is whether or not you live in the designated catastrophe area. Here are the 14 counties this area includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aransas</li>\n<li>Brazoria</li>\n<li>Calhoun</li>\n<li>Cameron</li>\n<li>Chambers</li>\n<li>Galveston</li>\n<li>Jefferson</li>\n<li>Kenedy</li>\n<li>Kleberg</li>\n<li>Matagorda</li>\n<li>Nueces</li>\n<li>Refugio</li>\n<li>San Patricio</li>\n<li>Willacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners in these counties, plus La Porte, Morgan’s Point, Pasadena, Seabrook, and Shore Acres in Harris County, face an increased risk for windstorms and hail. Unfortunately, their increased risk means many home insurance providers won’t cover the damage hurricanes and hailstorms cause.</p>\n<p>That’s a problem when a hurricane hits, but it can even be a problem beforehand. Lenders generally won’t work with homeowners who don’t have <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hail and windstorm coverage</a></p>\n<p>Living in the designated catastrophe area in Texas doesn’t mean you can’t find coverage. You may just have a harder time doing so. Typically, your first option is <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start/\">applying for insurance through a private insurer like Kin</a>. If that doesn’t work, you can try the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA). The state created TWIA specifically for homes in the designated catastrophe area that couldn’t get insurance from a private insurer. However, TWIA is considered insurer of last resort. You can only apply with TWIA if you’ve been turned down by at least one private insurance company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourhomeisinadesignatedcatastrophearea\">What to do if your home is in a designated catastrophe area</h2>\n<p>Your new home in Port Aransas may have stunning gulf views, but being that close to the beach does increase your exposure to wind and water damage. To stay protected, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check your homeowners insurance</strong>. Find out if your policy has windstorm and hail coverage sooner rather than later. Once a hurricane is in or near the Gulf of Mexico, you can’t purchase a policy or change your coverage until it has passed.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand your deductibles</strong>. Homeowners on the coast have a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> in addition to the flat standard deductible. In Texas, hurricane deductibles can be <strong>5%</strong> or more of your home’s insured value. Find out what your deductible is so you’re not surprised.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess the value of your possessions</strong>. A home inventory can help you decide if you have sufficient coverage. Plus, if you do experience a loss, this documentation can help speed up your claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider flood insurance</strong>. Homes in the designated catastrophe area face flood risk, too. Unfortunately, that’s another event home insurance and hurricane coverage exclude. You can <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">apply for flood insurance</a> with Kin.</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisadp1policy\">What is a DP1 policy?</h2>\n<p>A DP1 policy, also called Dwelling Fire Form 1, is a <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of home insurance policy</a> that protects a house from nine named perils – most notably fire. It’s usually used to insure vacant homes but can also be used for rental properties if landlords are on a tight budget.</p>\n<p>Because DP1 is a named perils policy, it only covers damage to the home from those nine incidents listed in the policy. Any source of damages that’s not in the policy isn’t covered. As you can imagine, that leaves a lot of room for gaps.</p>\n<p>For example, vandalism isn’t covered, and that’s damage vacant homes are especially prone to. If you have a DP1 policy and your home is vandalized, cleaning and repair costs will come out of pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdodp1policiescover\">What do DP1 policies cover?</h2>\n<p>The DP1 insurance policies cover the home for damage from nine <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire and lightning</li>\n<li>Internal and external explosions</li>\n<li>Windstorm</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Riots</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Aircrafts</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Volcanic explosions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If one of these incidents occurs at your property, it’s covered. If an incident not listed happens, it’s not covered. Notably, water damage from appliances or pipes isn’t covered, and that can be a potentially big gap in your coverage.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to read through the policy before you buy a DP1 policy. You don’t want to be stuck with enormous repairs bills that might otherwise be covered if you had a different policy, like a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to covering the structure of the home, DP1 also covers other structures (like garages, sheds, fences, etc.), personal property, and the fair rental value of the building. It can also cover personal liability and medical payments coverage, but neither of these usually come standard with the policy and must be added on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dp1isanactualcashvaluepolicy\">DP1 is an actual cash value policy</h2>\n<p>Another limitation of the DP1 policy is in how it pays out claims. This policy is paid on an <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> basis. That means depreciation is deducted from your claims payout.</p>\n<p>For example, say your roof suffers wind damage and your roof is 12 years old. The total repair cost will be $15,000.</p>\n<p>Your insurer will figure out your roof’s replacement cost and deduct its depreciation from your payout. That calculation looks something like this: R × (E - C) / E = ACV.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R = replacement cost of the item</li>\n<li>E = expected life (lifespan) of the item</li>\n<li>C = current life of the item</li>\n<li>ACV = actual cash value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if your roof has 15 more years of life in it, your payout comes to: $15,000 x (15-12) / 15 = $3,000. You’d be paying the other $12,000 out of pocket for the roof damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedsadp1policy\">Who needs a DP1 policy?</h2>\n<p>A DP1 policy is for property that’s not occupied by you, the owner. You might consider this policy if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Own a vacant property.</li>\n<li>Have a strict budget for rental property.</li>\n<li>Bought a new house and your old house is vacant pending a sale.</li>\n<li>Inherited a home that sits empty until probate is complete.</li>\n<li>Own investment property that’s between tenants (more than 30 days).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, if a home is going to be vacant for more than 30 days, a DP1 policy might be a good option. It can cover common perils that might not be noticed immediately because there’s no one on the property to see it. While the DP1 is also used by landlords with tenants, it’s not the most robust option. A DP2 or DP3 policy is usually a better fit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dp1vsdp2vsdp3\">DP1 vs. DP2 vs. DP3</h2>\n<p>There are three Dwelling Fire forms: DP1, DP2, and DP3. Each form offers more protection than the last.</p>\n<p>While the DP1 covers nine perils, the DP2 offers the same protections as DP1 but covers more perils – typically 18.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/glossary/dp2-policy/\">DP2 policy</a> usually covers the home for damage from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Riot</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Windstorm/Hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Aircrafts</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Cracking or bulging</li>\n<li>Freezing pipes</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Weight of snow</li>\n<li>Electrical damage</li>\n<li>Glass breakage</li>\n<li>Collapse</li>\n<li>Water or stream</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, DP2 covers more common events, like vandalism and freezing pipes. That’s important considering vacant homes are targets for vandals and at higher risk for burst pipes.</p>\n<p>The DP3 policy makes a leap in coverage. It’s an open-perils policy, meaning can cover ALL perils except the few it lists as exclusions. So instead of naming what it covers, it names the few exclusions that it doesn’t protect against.</p>\n<p>Instead of insuring the home for its actual cash value like DP1 and DP2, the DP3 policy insures the home for its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. That means it pays what it actually costs to repair your home with materials and labor at the current market rate. It does not subtract <a href=\"/glossary/depreciation/\">depreciation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetadp1policy\">How to get a DP1 policy</h2>\n<p>Protecting your home is what we do.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisadp2policy\">What is a DP2 policy?</h2>\n<p>Dwelling Fire Form 2, also known as a DP2 policy, is a named-perils insurance policy designed for rental properties. Because it’s a named-peril policy, DP2 only covers losses if they’re caused by one of 18 incidents listed in the policy.</p>\n<p>A DP2 policy is one of three common forms for <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>. The first, the <a href=\"/glossary/dp1-policy/\">DP1 policy</a>, is similar to DP2 in that it’s a named-perils policy. However, DP1 only covers nine named perils and insures the property for its actual cash value. That means the property’s depreciation is subtracted from the claims payout.</p>\n<p>A DP2 policy insures your property for its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>, which offers the full amount to replace or repair the property with new, similar items.</p>\n<p>The final form is the <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>, and it’s the most robust option because it protects against all sources of loss except those listed as exclusions. Like the DP2 policy, DP3 insures your property for its replacement cost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesadp2policycover\">What does a DP2 policy cover?</h2>\n<p>A DP2 policy covers damage to the primary structure as well as other structures on the property, such as sheds, fences, detached garages, and patio coverings. While DP2 doesn’t automatically include liability coverage, you can usually add it on to pay your legal fees if someone claims you’re responsible for their property damage or injury.</p>\n<p>DP2 pays claims only when the loss occurs from a covered event, or <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a>, listed in the policy. Policies can vary, but the perils usually named in a DP2 policy are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning.</li>\n<li>Windstorm and hail.</li>\n<li>Explosion.</li>\n<li>Riot.</li>\n<li>Aircraft.</li>\n<li>Vehicles.</li>\n<li>Smoke.</li>\n<li>Falling objects.</li>\n<li>Damage by burglars.</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption.</li>\n<li>Cracking and bulging.</li>\n<li>Freezing pipes.</li>\n<li>Electrical damage.</li>\n<li>Vandalism.</li>\n<li>Weight of snow.</li>\n<li>Discharge of water or steam.</li>\n<li>Glass breakage.</li>\n<li>Collapse.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Three of these – discharge of water or steam, cracking or bulging, and electrical damage – are only covered when they are caused by a sudden accident. Still, many landlords like the DP2 because it covers more perils than DP1 but isn’t as expensive as a DP3 policy. It’s the middle ground between coverage and cost that property owners on a tight budget often appreciate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dp2replacementcostcoverage\">DP2 replacement cost coverage</h3>\n<p>Not only does a DP2 policy cover more perils than the DP1 policy, but it also insures your property for its replacement cost rather than its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a>. The difference here is that replacement cost coverage pays what it costs to repair or replace your property at today’s prices. Actual cash value only covers the depreciated value.</p>\n<p>For example, assume you own a 1,500 square foot home that is 50 years old. The cost to rebuild it from the ground up is $175 per square foot or $262,500 to rebuild today. With a DP2 policy (or a DP3 policy), you get the full value up to policy limits so you can make repairs. A DP1 policy subtracts 50 years of wear and tear so you end up paying more of the rebuilding costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dp2fairrentalvaluecoverage\">DP2 fair rental value coverage</h3>\n<p>Unlike DP1, a DP2 policy usually includes coverage for loss of rents. This means your insurer pays your rental income if a covered peril makes your property uninhabitable. DP3 often has loss of rent coverage, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">Fair rental value coverage</a> is essential for landlords, and it’s one of the things that sets DP2 and DP3 policies apart from standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Because the property is an income source, landlords need to maintain their revenue stream even during a claim. Loss of rents can address that concern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dp2contentscoverage\">DP2 contents coverage</h3>\n<p>None of the landlord policies automatically include protection for the contents of your property, which makes sense considering you’re probably not going to keep any personal belongings there when people are renting. However, you can usually add limited coverage for contents to replace things like appliances you own but your tenants use. This might be $5,000 to $10,000 in coverage. If your tenants want to protect their personal belongings, they need renters insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"doesadp2policycovervacanthomes\">Does a DP2 policy cover vacant homes?</h3>\n<p>A DP2 policy is not designed for properties that sit vacant for an extended period. In fact, many events that DP2 lists as covered are excluded after the home has been empty for a while. The usual cutoff for a DP2 policy is anywhere from 30 to 60 days, depending on the insurer.</p>\n<p>The reason insurance companies don’t like to insure vacant properties is because no one is around to identify problems quickly. This often leads to bigger, more expensive claims.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine a pipe bursts in a vacant home. Rather than have someone shutting off the water immediately, the pipe continues to leak water and causes substantially more damage. Suddenly, a claim that might have been just a few thousand dollars turns into one that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentochooseadp2policy\">When to choose a DP2 policy</h2>\n<p>Of the three dwelling forms available, the DP2 is a good balance between coverage and affordability for many landlords. It’s important for property owners to read through the coverage and compare it to other policies before making a final decision.</p>\n<p>If you need help figuring out which landlord policy is right for you, give us a call!</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisadp3policy\">What is a DP3 policy?</h2>\n<p>A DP3 policy is dwelling property insurance that’s customized to fit homes with older roofs or homes used as investment properties. Many insurers don’t cover homes with roofs older than 10 years in coastal states or homes used for short or long-term rentals.</p>\n<p>Because this policy includes the <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">Roof Surfacing Payment Schedule</a> endorsement, it offers homeowners a major discount on their premium. This endorsement covers the roof for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> only when it’s damaged by wind or hail. For all other covered sources of damage, the roof and the rest of the home’s structure are insured for their <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>.</p>\n<p>Homeowners can also modify a DP3 policy by opting out of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> and adding <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental income protection</a>. These make DP3 a good choice when you’re renting your home to others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdodp3policiescover\">What do DP3 policies cover?</h2>\n<p>Dwelling property insurance policies typically cover the physical structure, but you can usually add endorsements to a DP3 to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to your personal property, like appliances in the home.</li>\n<li>Your personal liability.

But people often get dwelling property insurance if they have an older roof that’s made it difficult to insure their home.</p>\n<p>Here are a few good questions to ask before you decide on a DP3 policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is my roof 10 years old or older?</strong> For this one, it doesn’t matter whether or not you rent your home. An older roof can make you ineligible for coverage for many insurance companies.</li>\n<li><strong>What risks does this property face?</strong> DP3 is the only dwelling property policy written on an open perils basis. It provides broader coverage than <a href=\"/glossary/dp1-policy/\">DP1</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/dp2-policy/\">DP2</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>How important is my rental income to me?</strong> If rent is a major portion of your income, then loss of rent coverage is essential to your recovery, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Can I afford to repair damage to this property?</strong> Getting the full replacement cost value of your property can help you recover quickly, but only if you can get insurance in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Worth noting:</strong> While there are a lot of similarities between an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> and a DP3, a DP3 can cover some risks a standard HO3 can’t.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaneffectivecate\">What is an effective cate?</h2>\n<p>Every insurance contract, or policy, needs a specific start date so that both the policyholder and the insurance provider know when their responsibilities begin. This date is called the policy's effective date, and it indicates that your coverage has started.</p>\n<p>Without an effective date, there can be confusion over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Claims.</strong> You might think you have coverage because your insurance company issued the policy when, in fact, the terms of the contract haven’t taken effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium payments.</strong> The effective date signals the start of coverage, so it also indicates that you have to pay your premium﹘assuming you haven’t prepaid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the effective date on your policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declaration page</a>. Prior to the effective date, you may have a policy issued to you that hasn’t started coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"effectivedatevsdateofissue\">Effective date vs. date of issue</h3>\n<p>Your insurance policy actually has two important dates noted on the declarations page: the effective date and the date of issue. The first is the day coverage starts, but the second is the day the insurance company creates your policy. While these can be the same day, they might not be. You can pay for a policy and get it issued prior to the effective date being triggered.</p>\n<p>The date of issue is simply the day that you agreed to the terms of the policy. Coverage does not begin until the effective date rolls around whether that is the next day, a week later, or longer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyoureffectivedateisimportant\">Why your effective date is important</h2>\n<p>You need to know the correct effective date because you don’t want to have a gap in coverage that leaves you exposed to a potential loss. For instance, a gap can easily occur when you change insurance companies. You want your new policy to start the moment your old one expires, so your new policy needs an effective date that starts the day after the old policy’s expiration date. If these dates are a couple of days apart, you would be on the hook for any loss that occurs before your new policy takes effect.</p>\n<p>You also want to be careful about the effective date on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners' insurance</a> when you buy a house. Most mortgage lenders want you to have a policy for the property before they'll lend you the money, which technically means they want you to insure a home you haven’t yet bought. The workaround is to buy home insurance that takes effect on the day that escrow closes and you take possession of the house. Any earlier, and you’re paying for coverage on someone else’s home. A day later leaves you uninsured for a time.</p>\n<p>Once you have a policy issued, you can always adjust the effective date if necessary. If your final closing date is pushed back a week, you can contact your insurance company to change the effective date. There is no cost to do this, it just changes the day that coverage begins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"effectivedateexample\">Effective date example</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at an effective date example. Imagine you have an insurance policy that expires on April 10, which means your coverage ends at midnight on that date. On April 1, you decide to look for a new policy and find one from Kin that saves you money and offers better coverage, so you decide to switch.</p>\n<p>While you don’t want to pay for coverage twice, you also don’t want to forget to buy the new policy. You could cancel your current policy and wait for that insurer to send you a refund for the remaining premium, but that ties up your money for some time and can be a headache. The better option is to go ahead and purchase the new policy with an effective date of April 11. That way, your new policy starts the second April 11 rolls around and ensures that you don’t have a gap in coverage.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsuranceexclusion\">What is an insurance exclusion?</h2>\n<p>Insurance exclusions appear in a policy in one of two ways. The first is by naming the specific <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> that are covered so that any risk not listed in the policy is automatically excluded. This is usually called named-perils coverage, and an <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1 policy</a> is a good example. It names 10 perils that it covers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Damage to your house caused by those 10 events is covered. Everything else is excluded, so you can see how limited named-perils coverage is.</p>\n<p>The other way insurance exclusions show up is by listing each one in the policy. This is called open-perils or all-risk coverage, and having it your policy covers everything except what is named as an exclusion. An <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> is an example of open-perils coverage because it names the perils it excluded. Some examples of common insurance exclusions on an HO3 are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ordinance or law</li>\n<li>Earth movement</li>\n<li>Water from external sources</li>\n<li>Power failure</li>\n<li>Neglect</li>\n<li>War</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazard</li>\n<li>Intentional loss</li>\n<li>Government action</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An HO3 policy covers everything except these nine perils, so it provides broader protection than a named-risk policy like an HO1. You should note, however, that policies can have both types of coverage. For instance, an HO3 policy offers open-perils coverage for your dwelling, but named-perils coverage for your personal property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"specificinsuranceexclusionsexplained\">Specific insurance exclusions explained</h2>\n<p>Knowing what’s excluded from your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> is important to make sure you’re protected. Otherwise, you could end up paying for damage you thought was covered. This next section explains some of the more surprising insurance exclusions you may run across in your homeowners' policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordinanceorlaw\">Ordinance or law</h3>\n<p>Many homeowners insurance policies exclude losses related to the construction, repair, or demolition of a home when these are required by ordinance or law. For example, if your home insurance has this exclusion, then your insurer most likely won’t pay for any upgrades required by new building codes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthmovement\">Earth movement</h3>\n<p>Insurers typically exclude any loss arising from sudden shifts in the earth, such as landslides, mudslides, sinkholes, and earthquakes. Interestingly, earth movement caused by a fire or explosion is usually covered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"water\">Water</h3>\n<p>While the damage from a burst pipe in your home is covered, water from flash flooding, tsunamis, tidal water, storm surge, and levy breaks is often excluded. Additionally, sewage blockage and broken sump pumps are often part of this insurance exclusion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"powerfailure\">Power failure</h3>\n<p>This exclusion is a little tricky. <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-and-power-outages/\">Power outages</a> are generally not covered if the actual failure occurs away from your home. However, if the power failure causes a loss at your residence that’s covered by your policy, then your insurer may pay your claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"neglect\">Neglect</h3>\n<p>Insurance companies do not want to pay claims because you failed to take care of your property, so most homeowners' policies exclude damage caused by neglect. An example might be if you failed to replace a beam suffering from dry rot. If it falls and causes damage, your insurer will most likely deny the claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"warandnuclearhazard\">War and nuclear hazard</h3>\n<p>Losses arising from war or nuclear hazards are not covered. This could be damage from being directly in a war zone or a nuclear power plant having a catastrophe leading to a dangerous home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"intentionalloss\">Intentional loss</h3>\n<p>This probably goes without saying, but you cannot expect your insurer to pay a claim when you intentionally cause damage to your home. For example, someone who intentionally sets a fire off in the house cannot make a claim for fire damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"governmentaction\">Government action</h3>\n<p>Many homeowners insurance policies exclude losses that are the result of a government agency’s action, such as confiscating, destroying, or seizing your property. Sometimes there is an exception to this insurance exclusion for property destroyed by a government agency that’s trying to prevent a fire from spreading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingcoverageforexclusions\">Getting coverage for exclusions</h2>\n<p>Just because your homeowners' insurance excludes certain events doesn’t mean you can’t get coverage for them. Often, you can buy <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> or other policies to address the event in consideration.</p>\n<p>For example, most homeowners insurance policies don’t cover water damage from a sewer backup because that’s an external source that invades your home. But you can usually get an endorsement to cover it, or you might be up for a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance policy</a>. Similarly, you can get earthquake insurance in addition to your home insurance if you’re worried about earth movement.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisthefairplan\">What is the FAIR plan?</h2>\n<p>Not every home is in an ideal place for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> –&nbsp;at least as far as traditional home insurance companies are concerned. They often consider homes where there is a high risk for natural disasters uninsurable. When this happens, homeowners in some states can rely on FAIR plans to provide the coverage they need. However, FAIR plans are usually considered a “market of last resort,” which means homeowners have to be denied by other insurance companies before they can apply.</p>\n<p>FAIR Plans are usually subsidized by taxes and private insurance carriers that pool resources to pay claims. Unfortunately, the policies provided by these plans are often limited and offer the most basic coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeownersneedafairplan\">When do homeowners need a FAIR plan?</h2>\n<p>The most common reason homeowners end up with a FAIR plan is because they’re considered high risk, but what that means depends on your state. In many places, homes are more difficult to insure when they’re in an area known for frequent natural disasters. For example, <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a> has major geographic areas (some even within several city limits) that are deemed FAIR plan locations because of <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">wildfire risks</a>.</p>\n<p>Homeowners may also need a FAIR plan if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their home is in a high-crime area.</li>\n<li>Their home is in disrepair.</li>\n<li>They have filed a lot of claims in the past.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The specifics for any of these depend on your state’s FAIR plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesafairplancover\">What does a FAIR plan cover?</h2>\n<p>FAIR plans tend to be limited in the scope of coverage they offer. For example, traditional homeowners insurance policy offers six coverage areas, but some FAIR plans only cover the structure of your home﹘not any of the contents, or your personal liability.</p>\n<p>You may also find that FAIR plans limit the <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> covered under the policy. Many are named-peril policies, so they only cover the 16 or so events listed in the policy document. Compare that to an HO3 policy that covers all events unless they are specifically excluded from coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosignupforafairpplan\">How to sign up for a FAIR pPlan</h2>\n<p>Most states require that you get declined by standard insurance companies before you apply for a FAIR plan. Once you’ve met that requirement, then you can usually sign up for a FAIR plan by contacting an agent or broker who offers it. You may be able to find agents and brokers who can sell FAIR plans by going to the program’s website.</p>\n<p>You may also have to meet additional criteria. For example, many states only admit homes to their FAIR plans if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are in compliance with local building codes.</li>\n<li>Someone is living in the home.</li>\n<li>There are no open <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claims</a> on the home.</li>\n<li>The home doesn’t have an unsecured pool.</li>\n<li>No one on the property owns a <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">restricted dog breed</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FAIR plans do not necessarily take every applicant. If that happens, you may have to make major upgrades to your home. Discuss your plans with an insurance agent familiar with the FAIR plan in your state before you do so you know if you’re putting your money to good use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contactinformationforfairplans\">Contact information for FAIR plans</h3>\n<p>| State | Phone Number |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alabama Insurance Underwriting Association | 334-943-4029 |\n| California FAIR Plan Association | 213-487-0111 |\n| Connecticut FAIR Plan | 860-528-9546 |\n| Insurance Placement Facility of Delaware | 215-629-8800 |\n| District of Columbia Property Insurance Facility | 202-393-4640 |\n| Citizens Property Insurance Corporation | 850-513-3700 |\n| Georgia Underwriting Association | 770-923-7431 |\n| Hawaii Property Insurance Association | 808-531-1311 |\n| Illinois FAIR Plan Association | 312-861-0385 |\n| Indiana Basic Property Insurance Underwriting Association | 317-264-2310 |\n| Iowa FAIR Plan Association | 515-255-9531 |\n| Kansas All-Industry Placement Facility | 785-271-2300 |\n| Kentucky FAIR Plan Reinsurance Association | 502-425-9998 |\n| Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation | 504-831-6930 |\n| Maryland Joint Insurance Association | 410-539-6808 |\n| Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association | 617-723-3800 |\n| Michigan Basic Property Insurance Association | 313-877-7400 |\n| Minnesota FAIR Plan | 612-338-7584 |\n| Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association | 601-981-2915 |\n| Missouri Property Insurance Placement Facility | 314-421-0170 |\n| New Jersey Insurance Underwriting Association | 973-622-3838 |\n| New Mexico Property Insurance Program | 505-878-9563 |\n| New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association | 212-208-9700 |\n| North Carolina Joint Underwriting Association | 919-821-1299 |\n| Ohio FAIR Plan Underwriting Association | 614-839-6446 |\n| Oregon FAIR Plan Association | 503-643-5448 |\n| Insurance Placement Facility of Pennsylvania | 215-629-8800 |\n| Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association | 617-723-3800 |\n| South Carolina Wind and Hail Underwriting Association | 803-737-6180 |\n| Texas FAIR Plan Association | 512-899-4900 |\n| Texas Windstorm Insurance Association | 800-788-8247 |\n| Virginia Property Insurance Association | 804-591-3700 |\n| Washington FAIR Plan | 424-745-9808 |\n| West Virginia Essential Property Insurance Association | 215-629-8800 |\n| Wisconsin Insurance Plan | 414-291-5353 |</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfairrentalvaluecoverage\">What is fair rental value coverage?</h2>\n<p>Fair rental value coverage protects the investment part of your investment property. As a landlord, you likely rely on your rental revenue for income. But if a fire destroys your property, your tenant won’t be able to live at your property – and you won’t be able to collect rent. Even during a claim, your bills, like your mortgage, property taxes, etc., still need to be paid.</p>\n<p>That’s where fair rental value coverage can help. This part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a> can replace rent checks you would have received during a covered claim. That way you can still cover your bills and protect your income.</p>\n<p>For example, say your property catches fire and it will take three months to repair the building and remedy the smoke damage. If your property typically rents for $2,000 a month, you could make a claim to cover the $6,000 in lost rent.</p>\n<p>Fair rental value payments are available for up to 12 months or the time to repair or replace the property – whichever is shortest.</p>\n<p>As for your tenants who are out of a home while repairs are underway? Their renters insurance (<a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 policy</a>) can cover their temporary lodging.</p>\n<p>Fair rental value coverage is similar to <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> in a standard homeowners or renters policy. Loss of use helps cover additional costs, like lodging and transportation expenses, while living away from home during a covered claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfairrentalincomeprotectiondoesntcover\">What fair rental income protection doesn’t cover</h2>\n<p>Fair rental income protection does not cover every loss of rent situation. It only kicks in when your property is uninhabitable because of a covered claim. If the incident isn’t covered by your policy, the vacancy it causes won’t be covered either.</p>\n<p>For example, fair rental value coverage won’t help you out when a tenant breaks a lease or if you’re unable to find a tenant for the property.</p>\n<p>It also doesn’t cover temporary relocation or lodging expenses for your tenants. That’s a job for their renters insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isfairrentalvaluecoverageincludedinlandlordinsurance\">Is fair rental value coverage included in landlord insurance?</h2>\n<p>Fair rental value is automatically included in our landlord policies. If you work with a company other than Kin, that may not be the case. Be sure to ask about it and read over your policy carefully to make sure you’re fully protected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesfairrentalvaluecoveragepayfordamagetoyourproperty\">Does fair rental value coverage pay for damage to your property?</h2>\n<p>Fair rental value coverage is one part of your landlord insurance policy – Coverage D. It’s not the part that covers damage to your property. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling coverage (Coverage A)</a> pays for damages to the structure of your property, like water damage from leaking pipes. Fair rental value coverage kicks in when Coverage A does, so long as the claim makes the home uninhabitable. They work together in most cases.</p>\n<p>That said, you could have a Coverage A claim that <em>doesn’t</em> make the home uninhabitable and wouldn’t trigger fair rental value coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howisfairrentalvaluedetermined\">How is fair rental value determined?</h2>\n<p>When you do need to draw on your fair rental value coverage, your insurer will usually determine your payout based on the rental income immediately prior to the loss. It could also mean that your insurer calculates the fair market rental rate for your property by looking at similar properties in the area and seeing how much they rent for.</p>\n<p>You should also be familiar with how your fair rental value limits are defined in your policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Percentage Coverage:</strong> This means your fair rental value coverage is a percentage of your dwelling coverage (e.g., 20%). So if you have $200,000 in Coverage A, you’d have $40,000 in rental protection. Our fair rental value limits are set at 10% of Coverage A, but you can increase it to 20% or 30%.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum Time Amount:</strong> Fair rental value coverage does have a cap. It’s paid based on how long it takes to make the necessary repairs up to 12 months. Any lost income past that 12 months is your responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re a landlord, check out your policy’s rental income protection. If you have questions about this coverage, feel free to give us a call!</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatarefirehazardseverityzones\">What are Fire Hazard Severity Zones?</h2>\n<p>Fire Hazard Severity Zones are areas in <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a> that are prone to wildfires. These areas were first mapped in 1992 by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to help officials, property owners, and builders better protect structures and infrastructure by identifying areas where the chance for wildfires is moderate to very high.</p>\n<p>Originally, California’s fire zone map looked at state responsibility areas (SRAs) where the state is obligated to implement fire protection measures. Newer maps apply to SRAs and local responsibility areas (LRAs), or locations where local governments are responsible for fire protection. However, fire zone maps only show very high fire hazard zones for LRAs.</p>\n<p>Urban areas are treated differently than wildlands on fire zone maps because they don’t have the same degree of risk for wildfire. However, those sitting on the fringe of the wildlands tend to be at higher risk than homes located within the cities and towns. Fire zone maps do account for potential home damage due to burning embers being moved by winds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howarefirehazardseverityzonesdetermined\">How are Fire Hazard Severity Zones determined?</h2>\n<p>CAL FIRE determines uses <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">granular data</a> to create its fire zone maps, looking specifically at factors that create fire hazards. These include each location’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire history:</strong> CAL FIRE considers an area’s history to determine the likelihood of wildfire over a 30- to 50-year period.</li>\n<li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> This acts as fuel for a fire, so CAL FIRE looks at each area’s current vegetation and the potential changes over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather:</strong> Hot, dry, and windy climates cause fires to spread faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Topography:</strong> Fire often burns faster moving up steep slopes.</li>\n<li><strong>Crown fire potential:</strong> Fires that burn through the top layer of foliage are usually the most intense and most difficult to contain.</li>\n<li><strong>Ember production and movement:</strong> Burning embers blown ahead of a wildfire are a major cause of fire spread, especially of fire spread to urban areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, officials are looking at the <a href=\"/blog/california-wildfire-statistics/\">likelihood of a wildfire</a> erupting and spreading based on whether or not a fire has occurred in the same or nearby area and how much vegetation there is to fuel the fire. They then consider prior fire patterns in areas with similar geographic qualities such as mountain slopes and wind patterns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisthefirezonemapusedfor\">What is the Fire Zone Map used for?</h2>\n<p>Understanding the wildfire hazards in their area helps homeowners defend against the risk. For example, every home located within a moderate, high, or very high-risk zone should have at least 100 feet of defensible space as a buffer between vegetation and your property. This is most often accomplished by clearing away brush.</p>\n<p>New homebuyers should be aware of fire zone maps and check if the property they’re interested in is in an FHSZ, too, because it can make buying <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> complicated. This information should be disclosed before the sale is completed.</p>\n<p>Builders can also use fire zone maps to make sure they meet building standards for new construction and the infrastructure around new structures. This includes using fire-resistant roofing materials and closing off home eaves on a home’s perimeter.</p>\n<p>Finally, state and local officials need to know the FHSZ in their areas so they can make smart choices when allocating resources each year. For instance, they may need to increase road widths to make it easier for fire and rescue units to move quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtotellifyourhomeisinafirehazardseverityzone\">How to tell if your home is in a Fire Hazard Severity Zone</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/789d5286736248f69c4515c04f58f414\">California Fire Hazard Severity Zone Viewer</a> to view California’s fire zone map. To see your specific property, click on the binocular icon on the left side of the map and enter your address. Remember, however, that this map only shows SRAs with a moderate to very high fire hazard exposure and LRAs with very high exposure, as indicated by the legend to the right of the map. If your property is in an LRA with moderate or high exposure, this map won’t show it.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfireinsurance\">What is fire insurance?</h2>\n<p>Fire insurance works much like any insurance policy works. You purchase coverage and if a fire occurs, you file a <a href=\"/blog/what-is-an-insurance-claim/\">claim</a>. If circumstances warrant it, your insurance company pays for the damage the fire caused up to the policy limits minus any deductible you selected for your policy.</p>\n<p>Just about every homeowner finds fire insurance coverage in their home insurance policies. In those cases, fire insurance typically pays for damages to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your home.</li>\n<li>The contents of your home, such as appliances and furniture.</li>\n<li>Other structures on your property like sheds or gazebos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, fire coverage in <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> may pay for additional living expenses if you can’t live in your home (or use it optimally) during a claim. Additional living expenses may include the cost of staying in a hotel while your home is being fixed or eating out if your kitchen was destroyed in a fire.</p>\n<p>Homeowners can also purchase standalone fire coverage, sometimes called <a href=\"/glossary/dp1-policy/\">dwelling fire insurance</a>. These can be useful for a vacation home or if a home is particularly susceptible to fires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesntfireinsurancecover\">What doesn't fire insurance cover?</h2>\n<p>Like most insurance policies, fire insurance has coverage limits that are established by your insurance company when it is written. But insurers also limit coverage by adding exclusions to your coverage. Fire insurance policies often exclude damage if the fire was caused by certain events or <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>.</p>\n<p>For instance, many policies don’t pay for fire damage if the fire was caused by war or nuclear radiation. Insurers also don’t pay claims if you intentionally set the fire. And some insurance companies exclude fire in hot wildfire zones and require homeowners to buy <a href=\"/home-insurance/wildfire-insurance/\">specialized wildfire protection</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, your home may not be protected if it remains vacant for more than 30 days. Most home policies limit coverage on vacant houses because empty houses invite trouble that increases the risk for a substantial loss. Should you need to leave your home vacant for an extended period, talk to your insurance representative about getting vacant home insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesfireinsuranceofferreplacementcostoractualcashvaluecoverage\">Does fire insurance offer replacement cost or actual cash value coverage?</h2>\n<p>It depends on the type of policy and how it's written. For example, the HO3 policies we offer can cover the <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> of your home, but some policies on the market today may only insure your home for its actual cash value (ACV). For example, an HO1 policy can be written as replacement cost or ACV coverage for the home.</p>\n<p>Understanding the difference between these two terms can be the difference between having sufficient coverage and ending up without enough money to rebuild your home.</p>\n<p>Insuring your home for its replacement cost means your insurance company pays what it costs to rebuild your home from the ground up. It covers the exact square footage with the same type and quality of building materials. <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">Actual cash value</a> only covers the depreciated value of your home. ACV policies are often cheaper, but that’s because they cover less of your home’s value. People don’t always realize that their dwelling coverage limit is less than what they need to replace their home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doineedfireinsurance\">Do I need fire insurance?</h2>\n<p>Most lenders want homeowners to obtain valid homeowners insurance that includes fire coverage. Even if you aren’t required to get a policy, protecting your largest asset with insurance makes a lot of sense. The <a href=\"/blog/most-common-home-insurance-claims/\">average cost of a fire damage claim is $79,785</a>. That’s a lot of money even for a partial loss. A total loss could set you back several hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs. Unless you have the resources to rebuild on your own, you need fire insurance.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzonea\">What is Flood Zone A?</h2>\n<p>Some areas are more prone to flooding than other areas, and that’s true for places designated as Zone A. Flood Zone A refers to low-lying areas close to lakes, ponds and other large bodies of water. Because of its low elevation and proximity to water, Flood Zone A is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) as designated by FEMA’s flood maps.</p>\n<p>SFHAs have a 1% annual chance of flooding (this is also called a 100-year flood or base flood). In other words, homes in these areas face a 1% risk of serious flooding each year. Over the course of a 30-year mortgage, there is a 26% chance of flooding.</p>\n<p>Zone A is further broken down into other <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a> that are named to designate how the area might be flooded: Zone AE, AH, AO, and A99. All zones in Zone A have the same base flood insurance rates, but premiums vary based on the home’s unique qualities and elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiszoneasbasefloodelevation\">What is Zone A’s base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p>Zone A doesn’t have a determined base flood elevation (BFE), which can make new construction in these areas tricky. Base flood elevation is the height to which floodwaters are expected to rise during a 100-year flood. This is an important benchmark when building new structures with flood-proofing features. BFE is also used to calculate flood insurance premiums. Generally, the higher the BFE, the more likely the area is to face severe flooding, and the higher the premium.</p>\n<p>Even without parcel by parcel mapping, this zone is considered to be a volatile area because it’s near lakes, rivers, streams, or other large bodies of water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehomesinfloodzonearequiredtohavefloodinsurance\">Are homes in Flood Zone A required to have flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>It depends on your mortgage. If you have a federally backed mortgage, like an FHA, USDA, or VA loan, you’re required to have flood insurance if your home is in a Special Flood Hazard Area. That includes Flood Zone A.</p>\n<p>While a 1% chance of a flood in any given year doesn’t sound like a big risk, lenders know that major storms and hurricanes are causing more and more flooding each year. You’ll want to make sure you protect your home and what’s inside.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that it only takes an inch of standing water to do thousands of dollars worth of damage to your home and your belongings. Even if flood insurance isn’t required by your lender, if you live in Zone A, it’s smart to have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Remember, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t cover water damage from floods. It can cover damage from burst pipes in your house but not damage from storm surges or rising water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thenfipvsprivatefloodinsurance\">The NFIP vs. private flood insurance</h2>\n<p>Many assume that because the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is backed by a federal agency, its insurance is comprehensive. But the truth is the policy can be limiting, starting with what the NFIP counts as a flood. A certain number of homes in a specific area must be affected by the same problem. If your home is an isolated incident, your NFIP policy may not cover the flood damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the NFIP policy has a 30-day waiting period for its coverage to take effect and only covers the home up to $250,000 and belongings to $100,000.</p>\n<p>By contrast, our flood insurance endorsement can be added to your homeowners policy immediately – there’s no waiting period. Plus, we match your flood limits to your homeowners policy limits so you get more coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinzonea\">How much does flood insurance cost in Zone A?</h2>\n<p>Our flood coverage is cheaper than the NFIP in most of Florida. For example, for Flood Zone A, our average premium is $334. The NFIP's average for Zone A is $2,841 a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforhomeownersinfloodzonea\">Tips for Homeowners in Flood Zone A</h2>\n<p>If your home is in Flood Zone A, it’s smart to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure the lowest floor elevation is at or above the base flood elevation.</li>\n<li>Don’t use enclosed areas below the lowest floor as living space.</li>\n<li>Keep all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment above the BFE.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"learnmoreaboutfloodzones\">Learn More about Flood Zones</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">Flood Zone AH</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">Flood Zone AO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-b/\">Flood Zone B</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-c/\">Flood Zone C</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-v/\">Flood Zone V</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Flood Zone VE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Flood Zone X</a></li>\n</ul>"

The area is subject to <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/node/404233\">mandatory purchase requirements</a>, so federally-backed or regulated lenders can only offer mortgages to homeowners who have a policy. Your rate will reflect the risk posed by your specific location (i.e., a home closer to a river is classified differently than a home near a park).</p>\n<p>Homes built in Flood Zone AE must meet the following regulations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lowest level of the home must be at or above the base flood elevation (BFE) or the height floodwaters are expected to rise during a base flood.</li>\n<li>Enclosed areas below the BFE, like a basement, cannot be used as a living area.</li>\n<li>All electrical, plumbing, and HVAC equipment must be kept above the BFE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recently built homes most likely meet these requirements, but older homes may need to be updated so systems are away from potential flooding. Moreover, flood insurance may not cover personal belongings stored below the BFE, so move any valuable property to a higher level. You also want to get an elevation certificate so your insurance agent can properly price their policy and offer any pertinent discounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinfloodzoneae\">How much does flood insurance cost in Flood Zone AE?</h2>\n<p>Our flood insurance premiums for Zone AE average $424 a year.

Preventing a claim is as powerful, if not more powerful, than filing a claim. Here are some <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">flood prevention tips</a> to keep your home and belongings safer from damaging floodwaters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintainyourproperty\">Maintain your property</h3>\n<p>Did you know that property maintenance can reduce the chance of flood damage? By clearing gutters and positioning rain spouts so runoff moves away from your home, you reduce your chance of having a home flood. Also, pay attention to where water collects in your yard when it does rain. You may be able to adjust your landscaping to prevent water from pooling near the foundation of your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"callthewaterservicesdepartment\">Call the water services department</h3>\n<p>Flooding is often a community issue rather than a problem with one particular property. As such, your city and county water services departments should have a plan to help reduce and prevent flooding in your area. If you’re seeing streets and parks flooding after a rain, talk to officials about remedies such as improved drainage to make the area safer for all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"haveaplan\">Have a plan</h3>\n<p>You want to have a plan ready so you know <a href=\"/blog/what-to-do-during-a-flood/\">what to do if a flood is imminent</a>. This could mean placing sandbags at doorways to direct the flow of water away from the structure or moving belongings to a higher floor or on top of counters.</p>\n<p>Floods can also require evacuation, so you need to prepare for that possibility if you live in Flood Zone AE. Put together an emergency kit ready with essentials so that you can leave on a moment’s notice if necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reviewyourinsurance\">Review your insurance</h3>\n<p>While flood insurance can’t stop a flood from coming, making sure you have the right amount of coverage can make it easier to deal with the aftermath. If you bought flood insurance when you first bought your home and haven’t looked at it since, you may be underinsured. Go over your policy with your insurance provider and make sure your coverage accounts for any upgrades, renovations, or major purchases,</p>\n<p>Traditional homeowners insurance doesn’t cover damages from floods. If you don’t have flood insurance, consider it. If you do have it, make sure the coverages are up to date for your structure and belongings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"learnmoreaboutfloodzones\">Learn more about flood zones</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">Flood Zone AH</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">Flood Zone AO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-b/\">Flood Zone B</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-c/\">Flood Zone C</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-v/\">Flood Zone V</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Flood Zone VE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Flood Zone X</a></li>\n</ul>"

Federally backed or regulated lenders can only fund a mortgage if you have flood insurance, and they’ll impose a policy through escrow if you allow your coverage to lapse.</p>\n<p>Knowing that it only takes an inch of water to cause some <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/calculator\">$25,000 worth of property damage</a> should be incentive enough to look into a policy. While you may not be able to stop a flood from causing damage to your home, you can get the right coverage to pay for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insuringfloodzoneao\">Insuring Flood Zone AO</h2>\n<p>You can purchase flood insurance through the federally run <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)</a>, or you can buy it from a private carrier. The NFIP covers the vast majority of homeowners, it has a few disadvantages. First, the policy has a cap of $250,000 in dwelling coverage and $100,000 in <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings coverage</a>. If you lose more than these amounts in the flood, you pay for the extra out of your own pocket.</p>\n<p>Second, the NFIP policy has a 30-day waiting period before any coverage kicks in. This means any flood damage that occurs during the waiting period isn’t covered.</p>\n<p>Private flood insurance is often a better option. For instance, our flood insurance endorsement has no waiting period and offers higher limits. When you get our flood endorsement, you can match its limits to the ones already on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> for Coverage A and Coverage C.</p>\n<p>Adding a flood endorsement to your current policy can also make managing your insurance easier. You only have one premium to pay and only have one claims department to deal with if you have a loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinzoneao\">How much does flood insurance cost in Zone AO?</h2>\n<p>Our flood insurance premiums average $400 a year for Flood Zone AO. By contrast, homeowners pay an average of $1,130 per year for flood insurance from the NFIP. The price for your policy depends on the coverage amount you choose, as well as your home’s elevation and location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforhomeownersinfloodzoneao\">Tips for homeowners in Flood Zone AO</h2>\n<p>Taking steps to mitigate flood damage is a good way to keep your flood insurance premium more affordable.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzoneb\">What is Flood Zone B?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone B is a moderate-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a>. It's primarily known as an area of the 500-year flood, which means there is only a 0.20% risk of annual flooding. It may also be used to describe a base floodplain (i.e., an area with a 1% chance of flooding) with less significant hazards, such as those:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protected by levees or dams.</li>\n<li>With flooding depths of less than one foot.</li>\n<li>With drainage areas of less than one square mile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New and revised flood maps replace this designation with <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Zone X</a> (shaded).</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiszonebsbasefloodelevation\">What Is Zone B’s base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p>The base flood elevation (BFE) is the anticipated height of surface water during a 100-year flood. Insurance companies use this measurement when determining insurance rates and by contractors when building a home in an area with a high risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) doesn’t list any BFEs or depths for Flood Zone B. Despite this, Flood Zone B has the potential for floodwaters to be as deep as one foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehomesinfloodzonebrequiredtohavefloodinsurance\">Are homes in Flood Zone B required to have flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>Living in an area with moderate flood risk means homeowners in Flood Zone B are not in a Special Flood Hazard Area and aren’t required to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>. However, lenders may still make flood insurance a condition of your mortgage. Most lenders err on the side of caution when it comes to flooding thanks to an increase in flood frequency and depth. This is just one way <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change is impacting the cost of insurance</a> for homeowners.</p>\n<p>Just because you aren’t required to get flood insurance doesn’t mean your home is not at risk. Even an inch of water can cause tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage to your home’s structure and your belongings. Not having insurance means you’re responsible for the costs of repairs yourself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insuringfloodzoneb\">Insuring Flood Zone B</h2>\n<p>Homeowners have the option to buy flood insurance from the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)</a>, which is backed by FEMA, or from a private insurer. While the NFIP does cover the vast majority of homeowners, its policies have some key deficiencies you should be aware of. Most importantly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30-day waiting period before coverage starts.</li>\n<li>$250,000 cap on <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>$100,000 cap on <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings coverage</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Private insurance typically provides more options. For example, when you buy a flood insurance endorsement from us, you get immediate coverage with no waiting period and limits that match the coverage on your current homeowners insurance.</p>\n<p>By having your flood insurance as part of your homeowners insurance policy, you reduce the chance of gaps in your coverage. Plus, you have only one claims department to deal with when you have a loss. This eliminates a lot of frustration during a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinzoneb\">How much does flood insurance cost in Zone B?</h2>\n<p>Flood insurance costs are contingent on your flood zone, elevation, and home specifics.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzonec\">What is Flood Zone C?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone C sits above the 500-year flood level. While there may be some pooling and local drainage problems, the homes located in this <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> have little risk of flooding. As such, the area is not a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), and flood insurance is not mandatory. New and revised maps use <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Flood Zone X</a> in place of Flood Zone C.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzonecsbasefloodelevation\">What is Flood Zone C’s base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p>The base flood elevation (BFE) is the anticipated height of floodwaters during a base flood (i.e., a flood that has a 1% chance of occurring in a year). Flood Zone C is outside the area of a base flood, so it doesn't have a BFE.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean that Flood Zone C never floods; it just means the zone isn’t a designated base floodplain. Floods can still happen in Zone C, but they’re rare and don’t warrant the regulations you see in an SFHA.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isfloodinsurancerequiredinfloodzonec\">Is flood insurance required in Flood Zone C?</h2>\n<p>If you live in Flood Zone C, you’re lucky to live in a location that’s not known for flooding. As such, flood insurance is not required to have a mortgage like it is in <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a> and other high-risk areas.</p>\n<p>However, with climate change affecting storm intensity, you might want to look into flood insurance. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), just one inch of water can lead to <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance-cost/calculator\">more than $25,000 in damages</a> to both your house and your belongings. That’s a lot of damage from just a little bit of water.</p>\n<p>To protect yourself, consider getting flood insurance so you don’t have to pay for the expensive repairs after a flood out of your own pocket. Kin has a <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> starting at $175 a year that can give you peace of mind and comprehensive protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whygetfloodinsuranceinzonec\">Why get flood insurance in Zone C?</h2>\n<p>With such a low probability for flood, does it make sense to buy an insurance policy to cover the risk? Before you dismiss flood insurance altogether, you may want to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there areas in the community where water pools when it rains? Water pooling close to your home when it rains is a sign that drainage is not as great as it could be and your home could be at risk in a severe storm</li>\n<li>Is the city developing resources to prevent floods from occurring? If the city has been ignoring its infrastructure, your home could become a flood victim thanks to poor city planning.</li>\n<li>Will climate change increase the chance of flooding in your area? Climate change is leading to more frequent and severe storms. It might just take one El Nino year to create enough rain to cause flooding in your community where no one can remember it ever happening before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> usually covers internal water damage (like a pipe bursting in the house), but few pay for damages if a sewer backs up or your city’s drainage system causes issues. In fact, damage resulting from water rising outside the home is seldom covered by homeowners policies. If you’re concerned about any of these issues, you may want to inquire about adding flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinzonec\">How much does flood insurance cost in Zone C?</h2>\n<p>Because of the low-risk nature of Flood Zone C, we can offer flood insurance for as little as $175 per year. This is $252 less than the average annual cost of an NFIP policy in Zone C of $427.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nfipvsprivatefloodinsuranceforfloodzonec\">NFIP vs. private flood insurance for Flood Zone C</h2>\n<p>Homeowners generally have two options for getting flood insurance. The first is the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP). Backed by FEMA, the NFIP accounts for nearly 95% of all flood insurance policies. The other option is to look for a policy from a private insurance company.</p>\n<p>The NFIP may be a good choice for homeowners in SFHAs because it can’t refuse to cover a risk. However, NFIP policies only offer a maximum of $250,000 coverage and personal belongings to $100,000. This might not be enough for many homeowners. Plus, there’s a 30-day waiting period.</p>\n<p>Private insurers can usually offer higher limits and other coverage options that some homeowners may find more attractive to people. For instance, you can get a flood insurance endorsement added to your homeowners insurance policy that’s effective immediately. We can match its limits to the ones on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling insurance</a>, or Coverage A however large that number is. The same is true for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insurance</a>, or Coverage C.</p>\n<p>If you want flood insurance, contact your Kin representative today.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzonev\">What is Flood Zone V?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone V is the designation for coastal areas with an increased chance of flooding. The chance of a flood in Zone V is 1% annually, sometimes referred to as the 100-year flood, and 26% over the course of a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the V in Flood Zone V, as well as <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Flood Zone VE</a> and V1-30, stands for “velocity wave action.” These wind-driven waves can cause significant damage, putting area homes in danger. Plus, storm waves can move with such force that they continue inland beyond the point of initial impact.</p>\n<p>Because of these risks, Flood Zone V is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

Flood Zone V does not have any designated BFEs; however, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) states that <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/region2coastal/coastal-mapping-basics\">all V zones can experience waves three feet or higher</a>.

If you don’t have a federally insured loan, it is up to your lender as to whether or not they will require flood insurance.</p>\n<p>For those without a loan, you aren’t required to have flood insurance but may want to consider it because of the increased risk. Your homeowners insurance most likely doesn’t cover for flood damage, and that leaves you paying for repairs out of your own pocket.

While this is a federally backed program, it isn’t necessarily your best option.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzoneve\">What is Flood Zone VE?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone VE is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designation for high-risk coastal communities. It is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), which means homeowners in this <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> usually need flood insurance.</p>\n<p>On top of pooling water and flooding after heavy rains due to nearby streams or rivers, coastal areas have additional exposure thanks to storm surge. The “V” stands for the velocity generated by incoming waves during storms.</p>\n<p>Homeowners in Flood Zone VE have a one percent chance each year of seeing floodwaters rise to the area’s base flood elevation (BFE). The risk increases to 26 percent over the course of a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisfloodzonevesbasefloodelevation\">What is Flood Zone VE’s base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p>A base flood elevation is the height FEMA calculates waters can reach or exceed in a 100-year flood event. The BFEs in Flood Zone VE vary by location, but can be as high as 14 feet. You can go to FEMA’s <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search\">Flood Service Center</a> to search for your property’s BFE.</p>\n<p>While your BFE is a good indicator of an area’s flood risk, it can’t predict what will actually happen. Floods may occur more or less often or reach higher or lower levels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehomesinfloodzoneverequiredtohavefloodinsurance\">Are homes in Flood Zone VE required to have flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone VE is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where homeowners are required to buy <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> if they have a federally backed mortgage. Additionally, your home must meet certain guidelines to qualify for some flood insurance policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lowest inhabitable level must be above the BFE.</li>\n<li>Any unclosed area below the BFE can’t be used as living space.</li>\n<li>The structure must be elevated by piles, piers, posts, or column foundations.</li>\n<li>Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment needs to be above the BFE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you meet these standards, you may have a hard time getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Many companies won’t even offer policies to people in Flood Zone VE because of the increased risk. This is why the federal government created the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP). Most homeowners who need flood insurance but can’t find someone to insure them can get a policy through the NFIP.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thenfipvsprivatefloodinsuranceforfloodzoneve\">The NFIP vs. private flood insurance for Flood Zone VE</h2>\n<p>While the NFIP is the largest flood insurance program in the nation, it isn’t necessarily the cheapest or the best. The NFIP caps dwelling coverage at $250,000 and personal belongings at $100,000, which may not be enough for your particular situation, and the average policyholder pays $700 per year. That average, however, includes homeowners with very little flood risk.</p>\n<p>The NFIP also has a 30-day waiting period before your coverage takes effect. If your home floods during that 30 days, your NFIP policy doesn’t cover the damage.</p>\n<p>By contrast, private insurers can usually offer higher limits than what you’d get with the NFIP and give you more options, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your homeowners insurance to cover floods.</li>\n<li>A standalone flood insurance policy.</li>\n<li>Excess flood insurance that covers claims that exceed the limits of an NFIP policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need flood coverage immediately, then an endorsement is probably the best way to go. Ours can be added to your homeowners insurance with no waiting period, and we match your flood insurance to your homeowners limit so you get more coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinzoneve\">How much does flood insurance cost in Zone VE?</h2>\n<p>Flood insurance in Flood Zone VE can cost anywhere between $8,000 and $14,000 per year from the NFIP. That’s a wide range, but insurers look at a lot of variables when they price policies, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your building structure and value.</li>\n<li>The value of your personal belongings.</li>\n<li>Your flood zone.</li>\n<li>Your home’s lowest level in relation to your BFE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our policies average $1,202 per year for Flood Zone VE.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforhomeownersinfloodzoneve\">Tips for homeowners in Flood Zone VE</h2>\n<p>If you live in Flood Zone VE, you can better protect your home by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having a home raised above the BFE.</li>\n<li>Move essential home system equipment above the BFE.</li>\n<li>Landscape your yard so it slopes away from your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">Minimizing damage from a flood</a> is a good way to keep your flood insurance costs down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"learnmoreaboutfloodzones\">Learn more about flood zones</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">Flood Zone AH</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">Flood Zone AO</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-b/\">Flood Zone B</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-c/\">Flood Zone C</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-v/\">Flood Zone V</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Flood Zone X</a></li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatdoesfloodzonexmean\">What does Flood Zone X mean?</h2>\n<p>FEMA has two designations for Flood Zone X, one shaded and the other unshaded. Flood Zone X (shaded) indicates an area where the annual flood risk is between 1% and 0.2%. This is considered a moderate risk.</p>\n<p>When Zone X is unshaded, the risk for flood is less than 0.2 % and is protected from 100-year flood by a levee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiszonexsbasefloodelevation\">What is Zone X’s base flood elevation?</h2>\n<p>The base flood elevation (BFE) is the height of a flood would most likely reach based on historical data and geographic details. In other words, water is expected to rise to the BFE if there is a flood. However, FEMA has not set a BFE for either the shaded or the unshaded Flood Zone X because the area is considered outside of the flood risk region.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to double check your <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> and BFE, you can search your address via FEMA’s <a href=\"https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home\">Flood Map Service Center</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehomesinfloodzonexrequiredtohavefloodinsurance\">Are homes in Flood Zone X required to have flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>Flood Zone X is not a Special Flood Hazard Area like <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">AE</a>, so homeowners with a federally back mortgage aren’t required to get flood insurance. That said, you may still want to investigate your risk and consider getting a quote. This zone’s minimal flood risk is low, so coverage is considerably less expensive than other zones. The extra premium may be worth it during exceptionally rainy years.</p>\n<p>Areas that typically don’t see frequently flooding can, over time, develop drainage issues that lead to pooling near homes. According to FEMA, one inch of water can lead to nearly <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1499290622913-0bcd74f47bf20aa94998a5a920837710/Flood_Loss_Estimations_2017.pdf\">$27,000 worth of property damage</a>. That alone may make flood insurance a smart investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsurancecostinfloodzonex\">How much does flood insurance cost in Flood Zone X?</h2>\n<p>Because Flood Zone X is relatively low risk, our rates start as low as $175 a year. That's $252 less than the NFIP's average premium of $427 in Zone X.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thenfipvsprivatefloodinsuranceforfloodzonex\">The NFIP vs. private flood insurance for Flood Zone X</h2>\n<p>Homeowners in Flood Zone X who want flood insurance have two choices. You can either buy a policy from the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)</a> or get one through a private insurance company like Kin.</p>\n<p>Coverage from the NFIP is limited to $250,000 for your home and $100,000 for your belongings. Plus, policies take 30 days to kick in, which means any flood damage that occurs during the waiting period is not covered.</p>\n<p>Private insurers can typically offer more options and higher coverage limits than the NFIP. For example, we offer <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> as an add-on to your home insurance policy. There's no waiting period and we match your flood coverage limits to your dwelling, personal property, and other structures limits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipstominimizeflooddamageinfloodzonex\">Tips to minimize flood damage in Flood Zone X</h2>\n<p>Flood can happen anywhere, and the aftermath can be costly. Whether or not you get insurance, you want to reduce the potential expense. Here are some <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">tips to help you prevent flood damage</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Move equipment to higher floors</strong>: Make an effort to relocate items that could be damaged to a higher area if you get a flood warning. This means moving televisions, printers, and computers to the second floor or up on countertops.</li>\n<li><strong>Install backflow valves</strong>: Floodwaters might miss your home and still cause a strain on city systems. By installing backflow valves, you minimize the chance of sewer backup entering your house.</li>\n<li><strong>Make your voice heard</strong>: If you notice areas of minor flooding in the community after mild or moderate rain, talk to your local water management department about maintaining proper drainage. By speaking up, something can be done to prevent community flooding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Water damage is no joke.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatarefloodzones\">What are flood zones?</h2>\n<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps areas across the country and labels them based on their flood risk or type of flooding. That’s what flood zones are in a nutshell: shorthand for how likely flooding is in any given area.</p>\n<p>Many homeowners think they only need this coverage in high-risk areas, but in truth, <a href=\"/blog/flood-insurance-is-for-everyone/\">flood insurance is for every one</a>. Every area is technically a flood zone – it’s just a question of how much flooding may occur. There are low, moderate, and high-risk zones, and flood claims happen in all of them.</p>\n<p>Flood zones are used to determine <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> requirements and costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"highriskfloodzones\">High-risk flood zones</h3>\n<p>High-risk flood zones are at the greatest risk of experiencing a flood. The homes that are in these flood zones are designated with an A or V. Zone A designates inland flood zones while Zone V indicates coastal areas.</p>\n<p>These areas are also called Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Mortgage companies can only offer loans to homes in SFHAs if the homeowner gets flood insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moderatetolowriskfloodzones\">Moderate-to-low-risk flood zones</h3>\n<p>Moderate-to-low-risk flood zones are areas where flood risk is not as high as Zones A and V. However, these zones still account for more than 20% of flood insurance claims. The zone designations for moderate-to-low-risk flood zones are B,C, and X. The risk of flood in these flood zones is 0.2% or less each year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzoneswithundeterminedrisk\">Flood zones with undetermined risk</h3>\n<p>The undetermined risk flood zone simply means that analysis hasn’t been done for the area. The area in question may have a high risk of flooding or may have a low risk. Homeowners should assess their home risk independently and make plans to prepare for flood as needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisaspecialfloodhazardareasfha\">What is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)?</h2>\n<p>FEMA describes some flood zones as Special Flood Hazard Areas. Homeowners in a SHFA usually have to get flood insurance if they want a federally-backed mortgage. Flood Zones A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30, VE, and V are all SHFAs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"femafloodzonesexplained\">FEMA flood zones explained</h2>\n<p>FEMA gives each zone a letter grade based on the type and likelihood of flooding. Zones with a letter grade of A or V are considered high-risk areas with a one in four chance of flooding during a 30-year mortgage period. Those with letter grades of B, C, or X are considered low to moderate risk zones but still account for <a href=\"https://agents.floodsmart.gov/agents-guide/risks\">20 to 25 percent</a> of National Flood Insurance Program claims each year.</p>\n<p>Those in A and V zones may have subgrades of risk denoted by another letter or number. And anyone in Zone D sits in an undetermined risk zone. Let’s look at each zone in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highriskinlandzones\">High-risk inland zones</h2>\n<p>Zone A denotes inland areas that are at high risk for flooding and encompasses A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A1-A30. Flood insurance is required in Zone A because the area has a high chance of experiencing a <a href=\"/glossary/100-year-floodplain/\">100-Year Flood</a> – a flood that has a 1% annual chance of happening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonea\">Flood Zone A</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a> is a high-risk flood zone that has a 1% chance of flooding each year. Over the course of a 30-year mortgage, the likelihood of a flood is 26%. There are no detailed analyses of areas in Flood Zone A, so there are no depths or <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevations</a> (BFE) in this zone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonesaea1a30\">Flood Zones AE, A1-A30</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae\">Flood Zone AE</a> is a newer version of what used to be Flood Zones A1-A30. These zones have a BFE that’s used to determine the rate as shown in FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). These areas are subject to a 1% chance of flooding annually and are mandatory flood insurance areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzoneah\">Flood Zone AH</h3>\n<p>Those living in <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ah/\">Flood Zone AH</a> also have a 1% annual likelihood of flooding. This flooding is generally labeled with the probability of one to three feet of water that pools in areas. True to Flood Zone A, this area has a 26% chance of flooding over the course of a 30-years mortgage. These are mandatory insurance zones that have BFEs derived at selected intervals on the map.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzoneao\">Flood Zone AO</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ao/\">Flood Zone AO</a> is a specific zone for properties located near river or stream flood areas. Again, they still have a 1% chance of flooding each year with a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Flood depths are expected to range from one to three feet making these areas a required flood insurance zone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonear\">Flood Zone AR</h3>\n<p>Temporary flood insurance is required in Flood Zone AR. This zone has an increased flood risk while local authorities build or restore a flood control system like a levee or dam. The rates for Zone AR will not exceed the rates for an unnumbered A zone as long as the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management regulations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonea99\">Flood Zone A99</h3>\n<p>Those in Flood Zone A99 are near completed or nearly-completed federal flood protection systems like a dam, dike, or levee. These areas are still subject to the 1% annual flood risk and this zone rating can only be used when the protection system progress meets certain requirements. This is a required flood insurance zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highriskcoastalzones\">High-risk coastal zones</h2>\n<p>Zone V, VE, and V1-V30 are coastal regions with more risk of storm surges in addition to other forms of flooding. They are considered at risk from the velocity of coastal waves. Flood insurance is mandatory in these zones, which means residents need flood coverage before they can get a federally backed mortgage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonev\">Flood Zone V</h3>\n<p>Like Flood Zone A, <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-v/\">Flood Zone V</a> has a 1% annual chance of experiencing a flood and a 26% chance of flooding over the course of a 30-year mortgage. This zone does not provide BFE for homes in it but is considered high-risk with mandatory flood insurance requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonesvev1v30\">Flood Zones VE, V1-V30</h3>\n<p>Unlike the unnumbered Flood Zone V, the numbered zones have a flood map with BFEs determined within the zone. These have the same probability of flooding as Flood Zone V and have mandatory flood insurance requirements. Additionally, <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Flood Zone VE</a> usually indicates an area that is exposed to storm surge and is located near rivers or streams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zonesbcandxlowandmoderateriskzones\">Zones B, C, and X: low and moderate risk zones</h2>\n<p>Those in Flood Zones B, C, and X live in areas with low-to-moderate flood risk and have <a href=\"/blog/fema-flood-insurance-rates/\">flood insurance rates</a> that reflect it. The overall annual risk is 0.2% or less (in other words, a 500-year flood chance). Flood insurance is typically not required in these zones, but it’s usually still a smart proactive measure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonebandzonexshaded\">Flood Zone B and Zone X (Shaded)</h3>\n<p>Originally designated as <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-x/\">Flood Zone X</a> (shaded), <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-b/\">Flood Zone B</a> is an area with moderate risk flood zones. The chance of a flood is somewhere between the 100-year and 500-year flood. These areas are typically protected by levees or have shallow flooding areas. Flood depths average less than one foot and drainage is less than one square mile. These flood zones are not designated as Special Flood Hazard Areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonecandzonexunshaded\">Flood Zone C and Zone X (Unshaded)</h3>\n<p>Both <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-c/\">Flood Zone C</a> and Zone X (unshaded) are low-risk areas with a 0.2% chance of an annual flood. These zones usually have minimal flooding though there may be some ponding or local drainage problems. Zone X in particular is considered to be outside of the 500-year flood area and is protected from the 100-year flood by a levee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zonedthegreatunknown\">Zone D: the great unknown</h3>\n<p>Flood D is designed to catch all other risk areas that are not defined by other flood zones. No hazard risk analysis has been done in these regions yet, so flood insurance is generally not mandatory. Flood rates in this zone reflect the uncertainty of the flood risk.</p>\n<p>Need helping figuring out your flood zone? We can help with that when you apply for a flood insurance quote.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisthefirstnoticeoflossfnol\">What is the First Notice of Loss (FNOL)?</h2>\n<p>For many people, the only time they contact their carrier is on the day they buy their <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. But some, unfortunately, will have to call their insurance carrier because they suffered a loss. This call is the FNOL, and it starts the ball rolling on your <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeownersencounteranfnol\">When do homeowners encounter an FNOL?</h2>\n<p>Many homeowners may never hear the term “first notice of loss,” including those that have to file a claim. This is because calling either your insurance company is almost instinctual after an event causes a loss. In many cases, that phone call is their FNOL. Others may come across the term in the claims section on their insurance company’s website or on official intake forms their insurer asks them to complete.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, don’t be alarmed if you never hear this term. Your claims representative will take information about your loss and process the next steps of the claim whether you officially call it an FNOL or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howafirstnoticeoflossworks\">How a first notice of loss works</h2>\n<p>You initiate an FNOL when you experience a loss by calling your insurance company. For example, you may call your insurer after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your home is burglarized.</li>\n<li>A kitchen fire.</li>\n<li>Your guest slips on your icy driveway.</li>\n<li>A tree limb shatters your picture window.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the loss is, you must contact your insurance company to inform them that you need to file a claim. You can usually find contact information for your insurer’s claims department on its website.</p>\n<p>On the call, your claims representative will ask for certain information. This usually includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your policy number.</li>\n<li>The date, time, and location of the loss.</li>\n<li>A description of the damages.</li>\n<li>Circumstances around the loss.</li>\n<li>A police report in cases of theft.</li>\n<li>Witness’ names and addresses for liability claims.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is usually enough information for the representative to start a claim on your policy. The representative takes down all the information, assigns you a claim number, and notifies the claims department to put your issue in its queue for an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">adjuster</a> to handle.</p>\n<p>Once the claim is started, you will likely face additional questions as the adjuster investigates your loss. as well as more paperwork. But it all starts with the FNOL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyisanfnolimportant\">Why is an FNOL important?</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, an FNOL is important because your insurer can’t know that you had a loss unless you tell them about it. Your FNOL alerts your insurer to your issue and allows them to collect key details about the incident so they can properly process the claim.</p>\n<p>The details in your first notice of loss also help your insurer decide if a claim should be filed. The different coverages in your home insurance are triggered by certain circumstances, and in some cases, the circumstances you describe may not cause your coverage to kick in.</p>\n<p>In other cases, policy features may make a claim unnecessary. For example, say your $1,500 bike was stolen from your home, so you call your insurance company, give them your policy number, and describe the event. The representative, however, notices that your deductible is $2,000 and tells you it’s not worth filing a claim since the value of your bike is less than your deductible. Essentially, the FNOL gives the insurance company its first opportunity to assess whether or not your claim might be covered.</p>"

Regardless, you will be required to pay the lender for the policy they take out on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Why would a lender take this step? In short, your mortgage lender wants you to keep home safe – after all, they have a vested interest in your property. If you default on your loan, the lender has the right to foreclose on it. One way lenders ensure the well being of their investment is to require you to have homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whencanamortgagelenderbuyforceplacedinsurance\">When can a mortgage lender buy force-placed insurance?</h2>\n<p>These situations might prompt your lender to buy a policy for your home without your input:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t have homeowners insurance.</li>\n<li>Your homeowners insurance policy lapsed and you haven’t bought a new policy.</li>\n<li>Your current policy was cancelled due to nonpayment.</li>\n<li>Your insurer <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">declined to renew your policy</a> and you haven’t bought a different policy.</li>\n<li>Your lender hasn't received proof of insurance coverage even though you have a policy in place.</li>\n<li>You have homeowners insurance, but the coverage, deductible, or amount coverage doesn’t meet your lender’s requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howforceplacedinsurancehurtshomeowners\">How force-placed insurance hurts homeowners</h2>\n<p>Force-place coverage can put a homeowner who is already struggling financially even further behind. That’s because force-placed insurance is usually expensive as is, and the lender usually increases monthly mortgage payments to cover the cost of the insurance.</p>\n<p>But expense isn’t the only drawback to force-placed insurance. This policy often provides less coverage than standard homeowners insurance. While it does protect your dwelling for hazards like fire, windstorms, and vandalism, it usually won’t cover your personal belongings, furnishings, appliances, or personal liability.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell: force-placed insurance is more expensive and offers less protection than a standard homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yeslendersmustnotifyyoubeforebuyingforceplacedinsurance\">Yes, lenders must notify you before buying force-placed insurance</h2>\n<p>Mortgage lenders and loan services are federally required to notify you twice before buying force-placed insurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First notice:</strong> 45 days before it buys the coverage</li>\n<li><strong>Second notice:</strong> 30 days after the first notice and at least 15 days charging you for the coverage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the lender gets <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">proof of your coverage</a>, they must cancel the force-placed policy and refund you the cost of the policy for any period of overlapping coverage within 15 days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourlenderboughtforceplacedinsuranceforyourhome\">What to do if your lender bought force-placed insurance for your home</h2>\n<p>If your lender bought force-placed insurance in error, notify them immediately.

Once you have proof of coverage, send it to your servicer and request a cancellation of the policy they obtained for you.</p>\n<p>If your insurance policy was cancelled because your lender failed to pay your premium through your escrow account, you have grounds for a dispute. Usually, this means you send a formal letter – a notice of error – along with the insurance bill to your servicer.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisfungiandmoldinsurance\">What is fungi and mold insurance?</h2>\n<p>Mold insurance is a coverage often found in <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> that provides protection against damaging fungi and mold. Typically, it pays to repair damage caused by fungi, mold, wet or dry rot, or bacteria. However, not every homeowner's policy has mold protection, so homeowners need to read their policy’s fine print to determine if they have coverage and when it applies.</p>\n<p>Even when fungi and mold insurance is included, it’s often limited in scope. This is partly because of caps on the amount of coverage provided. For example, most of our policies include mold insurance with coverage limits of up to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$10,000 for losses you incur, such as the cost of hiring a mold remediation company.</li>\n<li>$50,000 of coverage for losses incurred by a third party, like medical bills for a visitor who gets sick from inhaling mold spores in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything above those coverage limits is on you. Luckily, these limits are usually enough to cover most mold remediation bills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenismoldcoveredbyinsurance\">When is mold covered by insurance?</h2>\n<p>Most fungi and mold insurance only kicks in when you have fungi, wet or dry rot, mold, yeast, or bacteria growing as the result of a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a>. That means mold caused by something that’s excluded from coverage, like external flooding, won’t be covered. Plus, you typically have a limited time for alerting your insurance company about mold damage that’s often initiated by the original claim. If you fail to tell your insurer within the allotted time, you may find that you’re paying for remediation on your own dime.</p>\n<p>For example, say a pipe bursts in your home leading to <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a> in the walls and cabinets. Burst pipes are a covered peril, so you make a claim with your insurance company. This starts the clock on any subsequent mold claims. If mold appears during that time, you need to tell your claims representative to get coverage.</p>\n<p>But let’s say the river next to your house floods your basement. In most cases, your insurance company won’t pay for the water damage or subsequent mold damage because homeowners' policies seldom cover floods. That means you’ll need to pay for the remediation on your own ﹘ unless, of course, you have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also note mold that is in the house upon purchase or caused by poor maintenance is usually not covered by homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoiknowifihavefungiandmoldinsurance\">How do I know if I have fungi and mold insurance?</h2>\n<p>The best way to know whether or not you have fungi and mold insurance is to read through your homeowners' policy. You’ll want to understand what your coverage limits are when they kick in, and if there’s a time limit for filing a claim. You can also ask your insurance representative about these things so that you fully understand your <a href=\"/blog/is-mold-covered-by-home-insurance/\">mold insurance coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>Our representatives are happy to explain your coverage when shopping for home insurance and point you towards the clause in your policy that provides the details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetfungiandmoldinsurance\">How to get fungi and mold insurance</h2>\n<p>If your homeowners' insurance doesn’t cover fungi and mold remediation, then you may want to talk to your agent about possible <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatgraceperiodmeans\">What grace period means</h2>\n<p>The brief window between when your premium is a day overdue and when your insurer cancels your policy is called a grace period. Insurance companies may give you anywhere from one to 30 days past the due date to pay your premium to maintain coverage. Without coverage, you would be responsible for paying for losses out of your own pocket. Plus, cancellations can make it difficult to get coverage from other insurance companies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongisagraceperiodininsurance\">How long is a grace period in insurance?</h2>\n<p>That depends on several factors, including the type of insurance policy, your insurance company, where you live, and how you pay for your policy.</p>\n<p>Some states require insurance carriers to have a grace period to make it easier for consumers to maintain coverage. In Florida, insurance carriers are required to give policyholders an option that offers a <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0600-0699/0627/Sections/0627.453.html\">grace period of no less than 30 days</a>.</p>\n<p>For us (in all states we serve to date – Florida, Louisiana, and California), an escrow-billed policy has a 50-day grace period after the effective date, but if the policyholder pays out of pocket, that grace period is 16 days after a missed payment.</p>\n<p>State governments have also mandated grace periods during unique circumstances. California, for example, enacted a <a href=\"https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0300-insurers/0200-bulletins/bulletin-notices-commiss-opinion/upload/Notice-of-Extended-Grace-Period-for-Insurance-Premium-Payments-Due-to-the-Disruption-Caused-by-the-COVID-19-Pandemic.pdf\">60 day grace period during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> to give policyholders more time to make payments given the uncertain financial times.</p>\n<p>On top of state regulations, insurers may have their own rules governing grace periods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoesagraceperiodwork\">How does a grace period work?</h2>\n<p>The way a grace period works is very simple. Your policy payment has a due date. After the due date, the grace period kicks in. So let’s say you have a 16-day grace period on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. You need to pay your premium sometime before the end of that 15-day window or your insurance company will cancel your coverage.</p>\n<p>Imagine what might happen if your policy doesn’t have a grace period and you forget to send in your premium. You’re likely to be without coverage immediately. Any <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> that would have been covered by your insurance policy is now your responsibility. Essentially, a grace period means you have a little wiggle room. You’re still insured by the policy so your insurance company can cover claims as long as you pay what you owe before the end of the grace period.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aretherepenaltieswithgraceperiods\">Are there penalties with grace periods?</h2>\n<p>Even though paying your premium in the grace period keeps your coverage intact, it’s technically a late payment. As a result, your insurance company may charge a late fee. Penalties are often flat fees, such as an additional $30 when you make a payment during the grace period. Not every insurer penalizes you, and some offer grace periods with no late fee at first, but a penalty later on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whygraceperiodsininsuranceareimportant\">Why grace periods in insurance are important</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies often see coverage gaps as red flags, especially when they’re your fault. Losing your insurance because you missed a payment is a big red flag that can make it difficult to find coverage and cause your rates to increase. Additionally, failure to pay your premium by the end of grace period will result in canceled coverage.</p>\n<p>The reasons for not paying insurance premiums are often errors outside of the policyholder’s control. Without grace periods, simple mistakes like payment getting lost in the mail or a bank error could cause many insurance policies to lapse. The idea with the grace period is to give policyholders enough time to rectify the payment problem and maintain coverage.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatishazardinsurance\">What is hazard insurance?</h2>\n<p>The term “hazard insurance” is usually used to describe the part of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> that pays for structural repairs if your home is damaged by a covered peril. Most homeowners policies have hazard insurance, and some also include additional protections, like coverage for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability</a>, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures on your property</a>.</p>\n<p>Lenders use the term hazard insurance a lot, so you’ll most likely come across it when finalizing your loan documents and closing on a house. You’ll be required to show your homeowners insurance has the appropriate hazard insurance to protect the property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoeshazardinsurancecover\">What does hazard insurance cover?</h2>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> (or hazards) that hazard insurance may cover, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Lightning</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Fallen trees</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Vehicles colliding with your home</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read through your home insurance policy for the full list of perils that are covered by your hazard insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesnthazardinsurancecover\">What doesn’t hazard insurance cover?</h2>\n<p>Hazard insurance in a homeowners policy generally doesn’t cover damage caused by flooding or storm surge from a hurricane. Earth movement, like earthquakes, landslides, and sinkholes, are also usually excluded. Homeowners often need a separate policy or <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">insurance endorsement</a> to cover these hazards.</p>\n<p>Additionally, hazard insurance typically only refers to <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>. Personal property and other structure coverages often protect against a similar list of perils, but aren’t usually described as hazard insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhazardinsuranceworks\">How hazard insurance works</h2>\n<p>Your hazard insurance works the same way the rest of your homeowners insurance policy works. If your home suffers damage from a covered peril, your hazard insurance kicks in to pay for the damages, up to the policy limits. Other parts of the policy may kick in as well, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use</a> and personal property coverage. You don’t need to do anything different to have the hazard insurance cover the claim.</p>\n<p>When you file a claim on your homeowners insurance, a claims representative reviews your insurance coverage and sets up the time for the <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> to assess the damage. Once the adjuster approves the claim, your claims representative processes it and issues a check so repairs can begin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydohomeownersneedhazardinsurance\">Why do homeowners need hazard insurance?</h2>\n<p>Hazard insurance is specifically required by mortgage companies. Lenders want homeowners to have coverage on the house so it can be repaired if there’s a significant loss.</p>\n<p>Imagine if there’s a fire that makes your home uninhabitable. The lender has a vested interest in the house being repaired, but you may have little incentive to pay your mortgage. You could choose to walk away and file bankruptcy. Requiring hazard insurance protects the lender’s investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoeshazardinsurancerelatetohomeownersinsurance\">How does hazard insurance relate to homeowners insurance?</h2>\n<p>Hazard insurance is part of your homeowners insurance policy. It specifically covers your dwelling for losses from things like fire, vandalism, and lightning. As a homeowner, you likely don’t need to think about hazard insurance if you have a good homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoeshazardinsurancecost\">How much does hazard insurance cost?</h2>\n<p>Because hazard insurance is part homeowners insurance, costs vary depending on your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location</li>\n<li>Size</li>\n<li>Building materials</li>\n<li>Other factors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your credit and claims history may also play a role in determining your rate. The national average for homeowners insurance is <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">$1,249 per year</a>, but that varies a lot by state.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for home insurance to meet your lender's hazard insurance requirement, get a quote form us today!

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatsanho1policy\">What's an HO1 policy?</h2>\n<p>HO1 policy, also called the basic form, is a bare bones <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of homeowners insurance</a>. It lists the specific perils, or events, your insurance provider covers. If a peril is not explicitly listed in the policy, it is not covered by HO1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdohomeownersneedtoknowaboutho1\">What do homeowners need to know about HO1?</h2>\n<p>First, it helps to know that insurance agents issue policies on policy forms. Each form addresses a different situation and set of risks. HO1 provides coverage for an owner-occupied, standalone home and its contents. It is a named-peril policy, which means it only covers the 10 <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> listed in the policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning.</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That list may seem comprehensive, but some important risks are missing. For instance, HO1 policies do not cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flood</li>\n<li>Earthquake</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These events are more common than you may think, plus they can cause significant and costly damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some HO1 policies do not cover your personal property even if it’s damaged by a named peril. In that case, homeowners may want to buy a separate policy for the contents of their home.</p>\n<p>These limitations make HO-1 policies unpopular. Homeowners can usually afford more comprehensive coverage on other forms, and that’s the kind of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> mortgage lenders typically want you to have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatshouldidoifihaveanho1policy\">What should I do if I have an HO1 policy?</h2>\n<p>You may need to look into supplemental insurance if you have an HO-1 policy. This can come in the form of endorsements to your current coverage or standalone policies for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flood</strong>. You can get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> from the National Flood Insurance Program or through a private insurer (like Kin!).</li>\n<li><strong>Earthquake</strong>. Many insurance carriers offer an earthquake option on their home insurance policies for an extra cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property</strong>. You can buy a policy specifically for the contents of your house or add a rider to your HO1. A rider adds to the overall cost of your home insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, your better option may be to find an open-perils policy. Plenty of insurers offer affordable open-perils coverage on the HO3 form, including Kin. Even better? <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policies</a> generally include personal property and personal liability coverage. And you don’t have to wait for your policy term to end before you shop around. You can switch home insurance carriers at any time.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanho2policy\">What is an HO2 policy?</h2>\n<p>An HO2 policy is a <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of home insurance</a> that is written on a named-perils basis. This means it only covers damage to your property that’s caused by one of the perils listed on the policy. Some HO2 policies also cover your personal property and liability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdohomeownersneedtoknowaboutho2policies\">What do homeowners need to know about HO2 policies?</h2>\n<p>Most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policies are written on standardized forms. These forms make it easier for states to regulate insurance. HO2 is simply one of those forms.</p>\n<p>HO-2 is sometimes called the broad form. This is because it covers the same 10 perils, or events, as <a href=\"/glossary/ho1-policy/\">HO1</a> plus a few extra. In total, an HO-2 policy covers these 16 perils:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge of water or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing of household systems</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because HO2 is a named-perils policy, it only pays for damage caused by one of these events. If anything else causes the damage, you must pay for the repairs.</p>\n<p>HO2 usually includes personal property coverage and personal liability coverage, too. For example, let’s say you experience a kitchen fire. Your HO2 policy may help pay for repairs to the structure of your house and cover the cost of damaged appliances and other personal belongings. And if a fire originates in your house and spreads to your neighbor's home, your personal liability protection may help pay for repairs you're liable for.</p>\n<p>While HO2 does offer broader coverage than HO1, it still excludes some common risks you may face. For instance, HO2 includes sudden and accidental discharge of water and steam but usually omits sewer backup and slow leaks.</p>\n<p>HO-2 also excludes coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Floods</a></li>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners who face these risks may want to consider additional insurance.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can get an HO-2 policy that insures your property’s replacement cost or <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value (ACV)</a>. Replacement cost coverage pays the cost of replacing or repairing your home minus your deductible. Actual cash value coverage means your insurer considers depreciation when it settles your claim. With ACV, your settlement may not be enough to replace your property.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isanho2policyenoughinsuranceformyhome\">Is an HO2 policy enough insurance for my home?</h2>\n<p>HO2 insurance is considered a middle-of-the-road policy. It offers more protection than an HO1 policy, but <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a> and <a href=\"/glossary/ho5-policy/\">HO5</a> offer even more. However, an HO2 policy can still be the right for you. Here are three questions to think about before you decide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is my home likely to suffer other kinds of damage?</strong> The 16 perils covered by HO2 represent some of the more common risks homeowners face. But the list leaves out other risks that can cause significant damage, like sewer backup, foundation leaks, and power failures.</li>\n<li><strong>What does my mortgage lender require?</strong> Most lenders require insurance for structures and real estate. An HO-2 policy usually satisfies this requirement while also adding coverage for your liability and personal property.</li>\n<li><strong>How much premium can I afford to pay?</strong> More protection almost always costs more money, so you need to consider your finances before you decide to upgrade. Take some time to comparison shop to see if you can find a better deal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting the appropriate insurance for your home means striking a balance between your risks and your budget. Do your research and compare your options before you buy.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanho3policy\">What is an HO3 policy?</h2>\n<p>An HO3 policy is the one of the most common <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">types of home insurance</a>. The coverage is written on an open-perils basis for your home and other structures, which means it can cover any risks except for those specifically <strong>excluded</strong> in the policy. However, it offers named-perils coverage for your personal property, meaning it only covers damage to belongings caused by the events listed in your policy.</p>\n<p>These policies are usually intended for the single-family homes, multi-family homes, and townhouses. The property owner must live in the home and not rent any part of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathomeownersneedtoknowaboutho3policies\">What homeowners need to know about HO3 policies</h2>\n<p>The first thing to know is <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> is written on a variety of forms. These forms standardize coverage from insurance company to insurance company. Which form your agent uses for your home depends largely on how much coverage you need.</p>\n<p>HO3 is typically used for owner-occupied homes because it offers reliable, affordable coverage for common risks.</p>\n<p>HO3 policies typically pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to the home (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>).</li>\n<li>Damage to other structures on your property, like fences or detached garages (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>).</li>\n<li>Damage to or theft of personal belongings, like clothes, furniture, etc (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a>).</li>\n<li>Additional living expenses when a covered claim keep you from living at home (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Coverage D</a>).</li>\n<li>Legal expenses when you or a household member is sued over someone's injuries or property damage (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Coverage E</a> or personal liability).</li>\n<li>Medical payments when guests are injured at your home (<a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Coverage F</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatperilsarecoveredinanho3policy\">What perils are covered in an HO3 policy?</h2>\n<p>For your home and other structures, HO3 is an <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">open-perils </a>policy. That means your insurance company can pay for damage to your home unless it’s caused by an event listed in the policy as an exclusion. Some common HO3 policy exclusions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earth movement, such as an earthquake, sinkhole, and mudflow.</li>\n<li>Water damage from <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood</a>, sewer backup, or water seeping in through the foundation.</li>\n<li>Demolition of your home required by law to bring it to code.</li>\n<li>Seizure or demolition by a government agency or public authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But coverage for the contents of your house is different. HO3 policies insure your personal property on a named-perils basis, meaning your insurer only pays for damage caused by events listed in the policy. Those named perils are usually the same 16 listed on an <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 policy</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Hail or windstorms</li>\n<li>Explosions</li>\n<li>Riots or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Damage from aircrafts</li>\n<li>Damage from vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Malicious mischief or vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruptions</li>\n<li>Falling objects</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental discharge of water or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing of household systems</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get open-perils coverage for your personal belongings by adding an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your policy.</p>\n<p>You could also schedule your valuable items. <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">Scheduled property </a>is an insurance term that means your items are individually listed in the policy along with the amount of coverage each gets. When property is scheduled, an HO3 policy insures it on an open-perils basis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho3andthemagicofreplacementcostcoverage\">HO3 and the magic of replacement cost coverage</h2>\n<p>One of the big benefits of an HO3 policy is that it offers<a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\"> replacement cost coverage</a> for your home and other structures. Some HO3 policies default to insuring personal belongings for their replacement cost; others require you to add that on.</p>\n<p>Instead of only paying out the depreciated value of your home or other structures like an <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value policy</a>, replacement cost coverage pays what it really costs to replace or rebuild with similar, new items today.</p>\n<p>Put another way: you'll actually have the funds you need to buy new replacements and rebuild your home after a loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetanho3insurancepolicy\">How to get an HO3 insurance policy</h2>\n<p>You’ve come to the right place!

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanho4policy\">What is an HO4 policy?</h2>\n<p>An HO4 policy, also called renters insurance, protects a renter’s personal property and addresses their personal liability. In other words, it can help pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacing your property when it’s stolen or damaged by a covered incident.</li>\n<li>Legal expenses when someone is injured in your rented space or you damage their property.</li>\n<li>Medical payments when you’re responsible for a visitor’s injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on where you buy this policy, it may come with other protections, too. For example, some HO4 policies also include <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>. This can help pay for temporary living expenses when a covered incident makes your place uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>No matter the type of property that’s rented – home, condo, townhome, or apartment – HO4 is the <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of home insurance policy</a> designed for renters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesanho4policycover\">What does an HO4 policy cover?</h2>\n<p>HO4 insurance is a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils</a> policy, which means the coverage steps in when the incidents listed in the policy damage your stuff.</p>\n<p>HO4 policies usually cover damage caused by these 16 named perils:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\n<li>Falling object</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental water overflow or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So say, for example, someone breaks into your apartment and steals your laptop, camera, and some jewelry. You would draw on your renters insurance to pay for their replacements, up to your policy limits.</p>\n<p>Because HO4 policies are designed primarily to cover <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, most can cover all types of belonging: clothes, furniture, electronics, etc.</p>\n<p>However, if you have rare and extremely valuable belongings (such as antiques, original artwork, or other high-value items), it may make sense to <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">schedule</a> those items. That means your high-value items get their own full-value coverage. That way, if someone steals your platinum diamond ring and a bunch of other things from your home, you won’t burn through your coverage limits with replacing just the valuable items.</p>\n<p>The other big benefit of an HO4 renters insurance policy is its personal liability and medical payments coverage. If you’ve ever had several guests over at your place, chances are you’ve seen the potential for accidents. Perhaps your friend is really enthusiastic dancer and slips and falls in your kitchen while getting down to Lizzo. Maybe you accidentally knock your guest’s phone off your counter and it shatters. Accidents happen all the time, and when they happen in your place, you can be held responsible for the financial aftermath.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability insurance</a> can help pay for incidents like your friend’s medical costs or broken phone.</p>\n<p>For minor bodily injuries visitors suffer in your apartment, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments coverage</a> may be enough. It can provide a small amount of coverage for immediate medical attention, like an ambulance ride.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatanho4policydoesntcover\">What an HO4 policy doesn’t cover</h2>\n<p>Unlike many other <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policies, HO4 doesn’t cover your dwelling or other buildings on the premises. That’s because as a renter, you don’t own the structures, and therefore it’s up to your landlord to insure these buildings.</p>\n<p>An HO4 policy also won’t cover damage caused by incidents that aren’t explicitly listed in your policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho4policiesactualcashvaluevsreplacementcost\">HO4 policies: Actual cash value vs. Replacement cost</h2>\n<p>Just like you can choose to insure your personal property at its replacement or actual cash value with homeowners insurance, most renters policies let you choose, too.</p>\n<p>Here’s the main difference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">Replacement cost property coverage</a> does not deduct your damaged or stolen item’s depreciation when it pays out a claim. That means your claim payout will usually be enough to help you replace your lost item with a similar new item. This distinction can make a world of difference when you need to replace damaged or stolen electronics, which depreciate fairly quickly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">Actual cash value coverage</a> does deduct depreciation from your claim payout. So say you bought a nice laptop two years ago for $1,200. Your insurance company will likely use a calculation like this to determine your payout:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>R × (E - C) / E = ACV</strong></p>\n<p>R = replacement cost of the item\nE = expected life (lifespan) of the item\nC = current life of the item\nACV = actual cash value</p>\n<p>If most laptops have an expected life of 5 years, your actual cash value payout comes to:</p>\n<p>$1,200 x (5-2) / 5 = <strong>$720</strong></p>\n<p>In other words, you’d be paying a fair chunk out of pocket to replace your lost laptop with a new, similar laptop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretofindho4insurance\">Where to find HO4 insurance</h2>\n<p>Though Kin specializes in <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, we can help you find quality renters coverage, too.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanho5policy\">What is an HO5 policy?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes called the comprehensive form, an HO5 policy is a <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of home insurance</a> written on an open-perils basis.

HO5 policies are written on open-perils forms, which means it lists the perils that your insurance doesn’t cover. HO5 usually excludes losses caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earth movement</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/law-ordinance-coverage/\">Ordinance or law</a></li>\n<li>Water damage from <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood</a>, sewer backup, or water seepage</li>\n<li>Power failure</li>\n<li>War</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazard</li>\n<li>Intentional loss</li>\n<li>Government action</li>\n<li>Collapse</li>\n<li>Theft to a dwelling under construction</li>\n<li>Vandalism or malicious mischief if vacant more than 60 days</li>\n<li>Mold, fungus, or wet rot</li>\n<li>Neglect, wear and tear, and deterioration</li>\n<li>Mechanical breakdown</li>\n<li>Smog, rust, and corrosion</li>\n<li>Smoke from agricultural smudging and industrial operations</li>\n<li>Discharge, dispersal, or seepage of pollutants</li>\n<li>Settling, shrinking, bulging, or expanding of your home’s foundation</li>\n<li>Infestation of birds, vermin, rodents, or insects</li>\n<li>Animals owned by insured</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3</a>, which offers open-perils protection only for the home and other structures, HO5 is written as open-perils for your home, other structures, and your personal property.</p>\n<p>Let’s say, for example, a neighbor drives their car through your living room. HO5 may pay for both the damage to your dwelling and the furniture inside. Other forms typically won't cover that cause of damage to personal property. They cover more typical incidents, like damage caused by windstorms, fire, theft, etc.</p>\n<p>Like an HO3 form, HO5 policies also include <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a> and medical payments coverage.</p>\n<p>Broader coverage often costs more, and HO-5 policies are no exception. You need to weigh the extra premium against the value of the additional protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3questionstoaskaboutanho5policy\">3 questions to ask about an HO5 policy</h2>\n<p>Before you buy your home insurance, ask your agent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is this an all-risk or open-peril policy?</strong> The HO5 form is standardized across the industry, but insurance carriers may market it under different names. Make sure you understand whether your policy is written as an open-peril or named-peril policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Are there any additional exemptions?</strong> HO5 may be called the comprehensive form, but that doesn’t mean it covers all property in all instances. Most policies have limited coverage for high-ticket items and may exclude others completely. That’s when scheduled personal property coverage comes in handy. It extends your limits on specific items to make sure they’re properly insured.</li>\n<li><strong>Does this policy pay the full replacement costs?</strong> Most home insurance is written as <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual-cash value</a> policies, which offers you less financial protection and only pays out what the depreciated item is worth. That’s why Kin only sells replacement-cost coverage – it actually helps you replace your lost items with new ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a reminder, an HO5 policy is robust, but an HO3 policy is a good fit for those who want reliable, extensive coverage that’s also affordable. Ask your agent what is appropriate for your needs.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisho6insurance\">What is HO6 insurance?</h2>\n<p>An HO6 policy, also known as <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a>, addresses the specific needs of condo owners. Unlike single-family homeowners, condo owners usually don’t have to insure the entire building where their home is located, and few have <a href=\"/blog/what-are-other-structures/\">other structures</a> on their property. A condo’s common areas are often covered by the condominium’s homeowners association (HOA) insurance policy, sometimes called its master policy. But condo owners still have to insure their individual units.</p>\n<p>Essentially, HO6 insurance steps in to pick up where the <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">HOA’s insurance policy</a> leaves off, meaning in most states it protects the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wall coverings of your unit</li>\n<li>Whatever is on the floors (e.g., laminate, tile, hardwood, carpet),</li>\n<li>All its contents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also protects you – your liability for injured guests, your additional living expenses if the unit becomes uninhabitable, and more. Let’s take a closer look.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesanho6policycover\">What does an HO6 policy cover?</h2>\n<p>A standard HO6 policy covers your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dwelling.</strong> In HO6 insurance, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> typically protects your individual unit from the wall coverings in, floor coverings, additions you add, what your condo association requires you to cover, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Belongings.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal property coverage</a> insures the belongings that make your condo a home, like furniture, cabinets, clothing, decor, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional living expenses.</strong> If a covered claim makes your home uninhabitable, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> can help pay for additional living expenses (think: takeout, a hotel stay, etc.).</li>\n<li><strong>Liability.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability coverage</a> can help pay for legal expenses when someone is hurt in your condo or you accidentally cause damage to someone’s property.</li>\n<li><strong>Guests’ medical bills.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> can cover small medical expenses when a guest has an injury in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All Kin HO6 insurance policies offer <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">open perils coverage</a> for the dwelling. That means we can cover damage from an incident that isn’t listed in the policy as an exclusion or as a peril insured against that’s not covered. In other words, a lot of incidents are covered – wind damage, fire, theft, vandalism, and more.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/condo-insurance/florida/\">Florida HO6 insurance</a> also includes $2,000 in <a href=\"/condo-insurance/loss-assessment-coverage/\">loss assessment coverage</a> (sometimes called special assessment coverage). This helps pay for shared losses that condo owners are responsible for. For example, say there’s a fire in the courtyard of your building, and your condo association’s policy limits fall short. The association may call for a special assessment, which divides the extra cost among all units to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>Loss assessment insurance can help pay for this unexpected expense, so long as the damage was caused by a covered incident.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatho6insurancedoesntcover\">What HO6 insurance doesn’t cover</h2>\n<p>Our HO6 insurance covers almost all perils except for the perils that aren’t covered or are excluded. They both have to do with the type of loss and what parts of your property is covered and what isn’t.</p>\n<p>Just like most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policies</a>, condo insurance doesn’t cover losses caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flood.</li>\n<li>Ground movement, like earthquakes, landslides, and sinkholes.</li>\n<li>Wear and tear.</li>\n<li>Pest infestations, such as <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">termites</a> or rodents.</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazards.</li>\n<li>Government action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An HO6 policy also doesn’t cover the whole building your unit is in. Your condo association’s master policy is responsible for parts of the building that are not part of your unit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatyourcondoassociationcovers\">What your condo association covers</h3>\n<p>Most condo associations or HOAs have a master insurance policy that covers the building itself, like the roof and exterior walls, and common areas, such as courtyards, fences, elevators, and hallways. Your HOA fees help cover the cost of the HOA insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, there are three types of condo master policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bare walls coverage.</strong> This is the most limited option for a master insurance policy and typically very common. It primarily covers the structure – including the exterior, roofing, framing, wiring, piping, insulation, and the drywall itself. It also covers common areas, like entryways.</li>\n<li><strong>Single entity coverage.</strong> In addition to what’s included in bare walls coverage, single entity coverage insures built-in fixtures in individual condo units (think cabinets).</li>\n<li><strong>All-in coverage.</strong> This is the most comprehensive of the three options. It covers the structure, shared property, and built-in fixtures in individual units, as well as individual condo unit improvements and additions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesho6insurancecost\">What does HO6 insurance cost?</h2>\n<p>The cost of your HO6 policy depends on your condo’s location, its safety features, the limits and deductibles you choose, and other factors. That said, our condo insurance costs start at $752 annually or around $62 per month in Florida.</p>\n<p>You might qualify for additional <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>, too. We offer discounts and credits for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The building’s wind mitigation.</li>\n<li>Mature condo owners.</li>\n<li>Responsible Repair (i.e., opting to not sign away your claims benefits to a third party).</li>\n<li>Choosing an electronic policy (we’re all about saving those trees!).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchho6insurancedoyouneed\">How much HO6 insurance do you need?</h2>\n<p>The amount of HO6 insurance you need mostly depends on how many belongings you have and the quality of your furniture and fixtures. As a very loose guide, this is about how much coverage you might want to carry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dwelling coverage:</strong> Your unit’s interior should be insured up to its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This is usually lower than what you paid for it because your condo association’s master policy covers the exterior.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage:</strong> It’s usually smart to insure your personal property for about 20 to 50 percent of your dwelling coverage. So if you have $75,000 in dwelling coverage, you want $15,000 to $37,500 in personal property coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use coverage:</strong> We typically suggest condo owners carry loss of use coverage limits that are around 20 percent of their dwelling coverage.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability coverage:</strong> Our standard personal liability coverage limits are $100,000, but you can choose to increase that if your situation warrants it.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments coverage:</strong> Our HO6 policies automatically include $1,000 in coverage, but you can add more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"ho6vsho3whatsthedifference\">HO6 vs HO3: What’s the difference?</h2>\n<p>The nice thing about being a condo owner is that you have a little help with caring for the building that houses your home – and your dwelling coverage reflects that. Here are some key differences between an HO6 policy and home insurance written as an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ho6vsho3differencesindwellingcoverage\">HO6 vs HO3: Differences in dwelling coverage</h3>\n<p>|  | HO6 | HO3 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Open perils dwelling coverage | Yes | Yes |\n| Replacement cost dwelling coverage | Yes | Yes |\n| Policy covers entire structure | No | Yes |\n| Covers other structures | Depends* | Yes |\n| Covers contents of the home | Yes | Yes |\n| Covers loss of use | Yes | Yes |\n| Covers personal liability | Yes** | Yes |\n| Covers medical payments | Yes | Yes |</p>\n<p><em>*HO6 policies generally extend coverage to areas & items an HOA requires owners to insure or that are already an owner's' responsibility</em></p>\n<p><em>**HOA policy covers common areas</em></p>\n<p>The owners of single-family homes have to insure everything on their own – the entire house, garage, fences, and other structures. But condo owners only have to insure from their units’ wall coverings into their living space and whatever else their condominium documents require them to cover. Your condo association’s master policy usually covers everything outside the walls of your unit.</p>\n<p>That’s why your condo’s dwelling coverage limits may be much less than what you paid for your unit. The condo association’s policy is essentially paying most of the dwelling insurance burden for you.</p>\n<p>Personal liability is another area where the difference between <a href=\"/faq/condo-insurance-vs-homeowners-insurance/\">condo insurance and homeowners insurance</a> is stark. If someone is hurt in the driveway of your single-family home, you’re liable for the injury and subsequent medical expenses.</p>\n<p>But if that injury happens in your condo building’s courtyard? The master insurance policy most likely covers the incident.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ho6foratownhouse\">HO6 for a townhouse</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you need an HO6 policy for a townhouse, but some townhomes need HO3 insurance. In general, you look to an HO6 policy if your townhouse:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shares walls with other unit owners.</li>\n<li>Has exteriors or common areas where owners share responsibility.</li>\n<li>Is part of an HOA that has a master policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if your townhome is freestanding and you’re responsible for the outside structure or your roof, then you may need HO3 insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetho6insurance\">How to get HO6 insurance</h2>\n<p>Getting a condo insurance policy online is super easy. Just type in your address and we’ll work our magic.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we might need two documents to get your coverage squared away:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A copy of your condo’s <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a>.</li>\n<li>Your declarations page from your current home insurance provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s really that easy!

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisesinsurance\">What is E&amp;S insurance?</h2>\n<p>Excess and surplus (E&amp;S) insurance is a type of insurance policy that's sold by E&amp;S insurers. Often, an E&amp;S policy can cover people that other carriers – sometimes called standard or <a href=\"/glossary/admitted-carrier/\">admitted carriers</a> – can't cover. For example, a standard carrier might not offer you a policy if your application shows insuring you is too risky. This can happen if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Live in a high-risk area.</strong> For example, homeowners may find it difficult to get <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">standard home insurance</a> because of their increased risk for wildfires or floods.</li>\n<li><strong>Have an unusual situation.</strong> Any number of characteristics can put you outside of a standard insurer’s underwriting guidelines. These might include unique building materials, a severe loss history, or criminal convictions.</li>\n<li><strong>Require higher limits.</strong> Every insurer has a coverage limit that makes them tap out, and your mansion on 30 acres may hit their max.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E&amp;S insurers can often offer coverage when standard carriers can’t because they’re not licensed (or admitted) to do business in the state. That doesn’t mean they aren’t licensed at all.</p>\n<p>In fact, every state has laws for how E&amp;S insurers operate. Most have to be licensed as a surplus lines producer in the state where they operate. Many are licensed as admitted carriers in the state where they incorporated. They're also usually required to meet <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">certain financial thresholds</a> to operate in a state. But because they aren’t admitted, they have more flexibility in the insurance coverage they offer.</p>\n<p>E&amp;S insurance may be more expensive than standard coverage because of the types of risks it covers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisanadmittedcarrier\">What is an admitted carrier?</h3>\n<p>Admitted carriers, also called standard carriers, are simply insurance companies licensed by the state to write and sell insurance in that state. To be admitted, the company has to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File their premium rates and policy forms, or contracts, with the state’s department of insurance.</li>\n<li>Comply with state insurance regulations.</li>\n<li>Contribute to the state’s guaranty fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guaranty fund pays policyholders’ claims if an admitted carrier becomes insolvent by paying claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedsesinsurance\">Who needs E&amp;S insurance?</h2>\n<p>Property owners who are unable to obtain insurance from an admitted carrier can get coverage from a surplus lines producer that offers E&amp;S insurance. The most common reason people turn to E&amp;S insurance is because their property faces higher-than-normal risk. Homes and businesses on the coast, in wildfire zones, or even in high-crime neighborhoods may need excess and surplus insurance.</p>\n<p>One good example of where homeowners often need E&amp;S insurance is Louisiana, particularly on the Gulf Coast. The <a href=\"/blog/louisiana-hurricane-history/\">area’s devastating history of hurricanes</a> means fewer admitted carriers want to cover the cost of claims. This pushes more Louisianans towards E&amp;S insurers for their homeowners insurance policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howareesinsurancecompaniesregulated\">How are E&amp;S insurance companies regulated?</h2>\n<p>Excess and surplus insurance companies don’t deal with the same regulations as admitted carriers, but that doesn’t mean they can do whatever they want.</p>\n<p>Most states require non-admitted insurers meet certain financial criteria to be eligible to operate in the state. Moreover, anyone who sells E&amp;S insurance must have a surplus lines insurance license. These individuals are usually responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding an E&amp;S insurance provider.</li>\n<li>Reporting the transaction to the state insurance regulators.</li>\n<li>Submitting the premium tax to the state tax authority.</li>\n<li>Making sure the transaction complies with the state E&amp;S insurance laws.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most states have something called a “diligent search requirement” that must be fulfilled before a surplus lines broker can even look for an E&amp;S policy. This means the broker must try to find coverage from an admitted carrier first. In many places, an applicant has to be denied coverage at least three times before a broker can turn to an excess and surplus insurance provider.</p>\n<p>Additionally, every state has a guaranty fund to pay policyholder’s claims if an admitted carrier becomes insolvent. However, almost every state also has some sort of entity that monitors the financial health of non-admitted carriers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areespoliciesdifferentfromstandardpolicies\">Are E&amp;S policies different from standard policies?</h2>\n<p>E&amp;S insurance policies can be different from policies offered by admitted carriers. The less stringent regulations means E&amp;S providers can modify the policy forms used by standard carriers to create more customized coverage. Some E&amp;S providers develop their own forms to better manage risk in the high-risk zones.</p>\n<p>These differences make it important for homeowners to read through their home policies in detail so they know what’s covered and what’s not. Ask plenty of questions so you know that you have sufficient coverage.</p>\n<p>If you've been denied coverage from an admitted carrier but still need insurance, give us a call. Our representatives will review your options to see how we can help out.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanho7policy\">What is an HO7 policy?</h2>\n<p>An HO7 policy, also known as <a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">mobile home insurance</a> or manufactured home insurance, is a <a href=\"/home-insurance/types-of-homeowners-insurance/\">type of homeowners insurance</a> that covers single-wide, double-wide, and triple-wide mobile homes on an <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">open-perils basis</a>.

That means an HO7 policy can help pay for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to your mobile home.</li>\n<li>Damage to detached structures on your property, like sheds or garages.</li>\n<li>Damage to or theft of your personal belongings.</li>\n<li>A place to stay if a covered claim keeps you from living at home during repairs.</li>\n<li>Legal expenses if someone sues you for damaging their property or causing their injuries.</li>\n<li>Immediate medical care if someone is injured while visiting your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some policies only offer <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> and pay out the depreciated value of your home or belongings, the HO7 policy offers <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost coverage</a> for your home, other structures, and personal property. In other words, it covers what it really costs to replace your home after a total loss or to buy similar, new belongings to replace your damaged ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ho7offersopenperilscoverageforyourhomeandotherstructures\">HO7 offers open-perils coverage for your home and other structures</h3>\n<p>The HO7 is an open perils (or all risk) policy. That means it covers your dwelling and other structures for all sources of loss or damage <strong>except</strong> those the policy lists as exclusions (we’ll get to those in a bit, but there are typically 20 exclusions). Nearly any loss scenario you can think of is covered: fire, burst pipes, theft, vandalism, hail, windstorms, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ho7offersnamedperilscoverageforyourbelongings\">HO7 offers named-perils coverage for your belongings</h3>\n<p>The HO7 policy covers your personal property a little differently.

Insurers typically use HO8 forms to insure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older homes, especially ones more than 40 years old.</li>\n<li>Registered landmarks.</li>\n<li>Architecturally significant homes.</li>\n<li>Homes constructed of hard-to-replace materials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HO8 policies may subtract depreciation when it pays out for damage. That cost is usually much smaller than the replacement cost, so your insurance company pays less after a loss. That keeps the overall cost of the HO8 policy down. The policy also offers other important coverages for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Personal liability</a></li>\n<li>Third-party medical expenses</li>\n<li>Personal property</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatperilsdoesanho8policycover\">What perils does an HO8 policy cover?</h2>\n<p>The HO-8 form is a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named-perils</a> policy.

For that, you may want an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Earthquake.</strong> There are no standard home insurance policies that cover earth movement of any kind.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatarehoafees\">What are HOA fees?</h2>\n<p>Your homeowner association (HOA) is responsible for maintaining the community spaces in your complex or subdivision while also setting rules to help the entire community to keep property values up and maintain safety. To do this, most HOAs charge homeowners monthly fees to cover each homeowner’s portion of the common property expenses.</p>\n<p>HOAs are most commonly found where homeowners share walls or have common areas, such as condominiums and townhouse communities. However, neighborhoods of detached single family homes may also have homeowner associations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdohoafeescover\">What do HOA fees cover?</h2>\n<p>HOA fees are mainly for maintenance, but that can mean many different costs depending on your HOA’s rules and regulations. There might also be some other expenses that your HOA needs to cover. In general, however, you can expect your HOA fees to go toward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Everyone uses common areas, so everyone shares in the upkeep of the property. That may include paying for landscapers to take care of the shared lawns, trees, and shrubs or a roofer when the roof needs repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Improvements:</strong> HOA fees often go toward upgrades to the community, such as installing a new playground in the community’s park or adding new security cameras.</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing expenses:</strong> When you live in an HOA-governed area, your fees may also pay for things like insurance, property taxes, and city services such as trash removal.</li>\n<li><strong>Employees:</strong> Some HOAs have employees, like security guards or a lifeguard for a community pool. Your HOA fees may cover their salaries as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most HOAs maintain a reserve or emergency fund to pay for unexpected expenses, such as a plumbing issue in one of the common areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arehoafeesworthit\">Are HOA fees worth it?</h2>\n<p>One of the main purposes of a homeowner association is to protect property values. Without assessing HOA fees, the association wouldn’t have the resources to perform this job. If the HOA doesn’t have the resources to pay for services, maintenance, and improvements, everyone would be responsible for those costs on their own. That doesn’t mean property values would necessarily drop if the HOA disappeared, but it does put them at greater risk if neighbors choose to ignore maintenance issues.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <a href=\"/blog/types-of-houses/\">types of housing structures</a> that most often have an HOA also have common areas, such as recreation centers, workout rooms, and playgrounds. Even small communities can have walkways and lawns. People who share spaces almost always need guidelines to both protect homeowners’ rights and clarify their responsibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doyouhavetopayhoafees\">Do you have to pay HOA fees?</h2>\n<p>You are obligated to pay HOA fees if you move into a community that is managed by a homeowner association. If you don’t, your HOA could assess late charges. They can even sue if you continue to ignore your fees. Should the association win the lawsuit, it may be allowed to take your back HOA fees out of your bank account or garnish your wages. Some states allow homeowner associations to start foreclosure proceedings on your property if you are consistently delinquent with HOA fees.</p>\n<p>In addition to the legal actions that the HOA can take against you, it can revoke your privileges to use common areas, such as recreation centers and pools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyyoushouldbudgetforhoafeesbeforeyourbuyahouse\">Why you should budget for HOA fees before your buy a house</h2>\n<p>HOA fees vary widely, depending on the size of your building or community and the number of services it needs to cover. The cost can be as little as $50 per month to well over $1,000 per month. While fees will depend on where you live and the amenities provided by your HOA, most people find that HOA fees are between $200 to $300 per month.</p>\n<p>You want to keep HOA fees in mind when you’re <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">looking to buy a home</a>. Not only are you responsible for your monthly mortgage payments, but you are also responsible for the HOA fees. Depending on how big those fees are, the extra cost could affect your budget.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatishoainsurance\">What is HOA insurance?</h2>\n<p>HOA insurance also called a master insurance policy or a condo master insurance policy is the insurance your homeowners' association maintains for the building your condo is in. This policy helps pay for damage to the building's exterior and common areas, like hallways, courtyards, and more. It also usually covers liability for incidents in common areas. However, it doesn't cover condo interiors – that's a job for <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>The HOA insurance premium is paid for in part by your HOA fees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoeshoainsurancecover\">What does HOA insurance cover?</h2>\n<p>HOA insurance covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building exteriors that belongs to the association.</li>\n<li>Shared space and property that belongs to the association.</li>\n<li>Liability for incidents that happen in shared spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if your condo is in a high-rise that catches fire, the HOA insurance policy can cover the cost of rebuilding and repairing the structure's exterior. The types of damage master insurance covers depends on whether it's a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">named perils or all perils policy</a>. The latter covers more types of damage, but both include coverage for fire, wind, theft, vandalism, and more.</p>\n<p>The HOA policy also usually includes coverage for shared property. For example, it may help pay for fire damage to elevators, roofs, courtyards, walkways, and more. The extent to which shared property is covered depends on your homeowners association and the type of policy it buys.</p>\n<p>The policy also usually includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a> for medical and legal expenses for bodily injuries or property damage that happen in shared areas, like courtyards, swimming pools, etc.</p>\n<p>The master policy will define where the HOA coverage stops and your condo insurance obligations begin. There are three types of HOA insurance policies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bare walls in.</strong> This offers very limited coverage for the structure and common areas of the building – nothing inside of the studs. It does usually cover the space between two units, like the studs between the walls and the subfloor between the top floor and unit ceiling below.</li>\n<li><strong>Walls in.</strong> This provides bare-walls coverage plus some coverage for the condo unit owners’ internal structure, including top flooring, cabinets, and countertops.</li>\n<li><strong>All in.</strong> This provides coverage for the internal structure of the condo unit, including appliances and security equipment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because of these variations, it’s important for condo unit owners to understand their HOA insurance and find condo insurance that properly fills these coverage gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoeshoainsurancework\">How does HOA insurance work?</h3>\n<p>The master insurance policy works like any other insurance policy. The HOA pays the premium, and if there's an incident the policy covers, the HOA board files the claim. The insurance carrier will investigate the damage to determine if the HOA is liable and whether its coverage applies.</p>\n<p>When the HOA makes a claim on its master policy, there will be a deductible just like any other insurance policy. In most cases, the HOA will then assess a pro-rated amount to each condo unit owner to pay the deductible. This is called a <a href=\"/condo-insurance/loss-assessment-coverage/\">loss assessment</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, assume an association has 10 condo unit owners with a master policy that covers the structure for $1 million with a 10 percent deductible. That's $100,000. The community center next to the pool burns down and will cost $150,000 to rebuild.</p>\n<p>This means insurance can pay $50,000 and the HOA must come up with $100,000 to meet its deductible. Each condo unit owner is responsible for $10,000 each.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hoainsurancevscondoinsurance\">HOA insurance vs. condo insurance</h3>\n<p>The master policy is the policy for the building exterior and its common areas while the condo unit owners policy – also called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 policy</a> – covers the individual unit from the walls in. It also covers the unit owner's personal belongings and liability.</p>\n<p>While we don't sell HOA insurance policies, we do offer condo insurance. To make sure your policy doesn't duplicate coverage the HOA insurance may offer, we'll review the master policy and tailor your coverage accordingly.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisahomeappraisal\">What is a home appraisal?</h2>\n<p>A home appraisal is a third-party, unbiased assessment of your property’s value. It compares your house to other homes being sold in your area to determine the fair market value.</p>\n<p>Lenders often demand a home appraisal during escrow to assess whether the home justifies the loan. They want to make sure that you’re not borrowing too much for what the house is worth. If your home’s value falls short, your lender may not fund the loan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homeappraisalvshomeinspection\">Home appraisal vs. home inspection</h3>\n<p>Home appraisals and home inspections are two different things and serve completely different purposes. A home appraisal usually comes at the end of the escrow process to determine the fair market value of the home. If the appraisal is low, buyers have the opportunity to negotiate the price down.</p>\n<p>A home inspection, however, happens early in the escrow process and gives a home buyer the details needed to fully understand the condition of the property. An inspection looks at all systems and essential structural components to see what is in working order, what needs to be replaced, and what may cause problems in the future. Homebuyers may <a href=\"/blog/when-to-walk-away-after-a-home-inspection/\">walk away from a house after an inspection</a>, or they can use it to negotiate repairs or price reductions in the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdohomeappraisalswork\">How do home appraisals work?</h2>\n<p>Your mortgage lender typically requests the home appraisal and chooses the appraiser. However, the appraiser is licensed by the state and is an impartial party to the transaction. This means they have no stake in how the home appraisal turns out and the results aren’t skewed toward any one party’s desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The appraiser walks around the property creating a plot plan with an outline of the home while also noting important details, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The true square footage.</li>\n<li>The number of bedrooms and bathrooms.</li>\n<li>The age and quality of the appliances.</li>\n<li>The functionality of the floor plan.</li>\n<li>The general condition of the home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But a home appraisal goes far beyond just inspecting your house. The appraiser also considers other houses in the area that have either been recently sold or are up for sale. These are called comparables, or comps. Your home is compared to the size and quality of these other houses, and its appraisal value is in large part determined by what other similar homes in the area are going for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisinahomeappraisalreport\">What is in a home appraisal report?</h2>\n<p>Home appraisals usually end up with a written report using the <a href=\"https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/media/12371/display\">Uniform Residential Appraisal Report</a> created by Fannie Mae. This helps make sure that appraisers are following the same guidelines for fairness when appraising properties.</p>\n<p>The appraisal report typically includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photos of the house from the street, the back, and possibly interior shots.</li>\n<li>A street map listing the address being appraised and all comparable properties with their proximity to the appraised home.</li>\n<li>A sketch of the exterior of the home.</li>\n<li>Street view photos of all comparable properties.</li>\n<li>Other information like market sales data, public records, and property tax records.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whathurtsahomeappraisal\">What hurts a home appraisal?</h2>\n<p>A number of things can hurt a home appraisal. Probably the most common is if your home is in worse condition than comps in the area. Then your appraisal will be below the comps' fair market value, so you want to clean up your property as much as possible and repair anything that’s clearly broken or damaged before seeking an appraisal.</p>\n<p>Another common problem for homeowners seeking appraisals is if home prices in the area are down. This can be especially true if someone else sold a home recently for below the market value. While a good appraiser may be able to determine the reason for the outlier, it could point to a downward trend in home values in the area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdohomeappraisalscost\">How much do home appraisals cost?</h2>\n<p>Many online sites estimate that an appraisal costs anywhere from $300 to $500, but they can vary even more depending on your area and the size of the home. Higher-end real estate markets such as San Francisco can see appraisals upwards of $750 or more. Your lender will give you the actual cost of the appraisal when it is ordered, but they will most likely provide a realistic estimate for your area at the start of escrow.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisahomeinspection\">What is a home inspection?</h2>\n<p>A home inspection is exactly what it sounds like: an up-close examination of a house. During an inspection, the inspector examines the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical structure, such as the roof, ceilings, walls, floors, windows, and doors.</li>\n<li>Mechanical systems, such as the HVAC unit, water pressure, and electrical systems.</li>\n<li>Major appliances, such as the oven, refrigerator, and garbage disposal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of the inspection is to let a prospective buyer know whether or not the home needs any repairs or has issues that may cause problems in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeinspectionsoccur\">When do home inspections occur?</h2>\n<p>Buyers normally have a set number of days to complete inspections once they have opened escrow on a home. The timeline varies from state to state but is usually somewhere around 18 days. The sooner the buyer does the initial inspection, the sooner they can tell if he wants to do specialized inspections.</p>\n<p>Specialized inspections take the information from the basic home inspection and go deeper. This might include something like calling a plumber to take a camera through the plumbing system to see if there are any worrisome issues. However, all inspections must be completed by the timeframe set in escrow or an extension must be approved by the sellers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinspectionchecklist\">Home inspection checklist</h2>\n<p>Every home inspector has a home inspection checklist, and knowing what’s on it can help you ask questions about any damage the inspector finds. Moreover, <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">self inspections</a> are becoming more common when you buy insurance. Either way, understanding what’s covered in a home inspection is a benefit to you.</p>\n<p>Most home inspection checklists start with the home’s physical condition to determine how well it’s been maintained. Key structures the inspector examines include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The roof:</strong> Is it in need of repair? How old is it? Does it need to be replaced?</li>\n<li><strong>Windows and doors:</strong> Do these work properly and lock appropriately.</li>\n<li><strong>Floors, walls, and ceilings:</strong> Do these appear level? Is there evidence of pest infestation?</li>\n<li><strong>Exterior walls:</strong> Is this in good repair? Are the bricks cracking or the paint peeling?</li>\n<li><strong>Basement and foundations:</strong> Are there any signs of water or leaks? Is the foundation sound? Are there places where rodents or other pests might get in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inspector may point a temperature reader at the exterior of vents while running the unit and note the temperature of the air forced out of the unit.</p>\n<p>Next, the inspector goes down a systems checklist. This typically includes checking</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heating and cooling systems</strong>: Are these operating? Are the air filters clean? Is there any rust?</li>\n<li><strong>Plumbing:</strong> How is the water pressure from the faucet and shower heads? Is there any rust or evidence of leaks?</li>\n<li><strong>Electrical:</strong> Is the wiring up to code? Are there any exposed wires or electrical splices?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the systems are done, the home inspector checks the major appliances that are included in the sale of the home. They will turn on your range, check the temperature in your refrigerator and freeze, and run your dishwasher and make note of any problem. Good inspectors also note the year, make, and model of the appliances in the report with the serial number to help homeowners get the right type of appliance repair needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyarehomeinspectionsimportant\">Why are home inspections important?</h2>\n<p>The home inspection is one of the most important steps in the <a href=\"/blog/process-of-buying-a-house/\">process of buying a home</a>. Without it, a home buyer has no way of knowing if the home is a money pit or not. After all, someone can slap on new paint and stage a home nicely to hide problems.</p>\n<p>This is why having a good home inspector is important. Your real estate agent can often recommend someone they have used in the past. Ask what’s included in their inspection and see if you can get a sample report. Remember, however, that once you start escrow, you’re on the clock and need to get the inspection done quickly as well as make decisions on whether or not you will ask for repairs, credits, or a reduction in price.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howdoesahomeloanwork\">How does a home loan work?</h2>\n<p>Home loans are typically provided by banks, credit unions, or private lenders. As the borrower, you agree to pay back the loan, or principal, plus a bit more, called the interest. The amount of interest you pay is based on the interest rate your lender charges.</p>\n<p>The time frame for paying off your home loan is called a term. During the term, you agree to make regular payments until you’ve paid both the principal and the interest. Most home loan terms are 15 or 30 years, but you can have a different term. Payments are often monthly, but can also be biweekly to accelerate the payoff process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeloanvsmortgage\">Home loan vs. mortgage</h2>\n<p>The home loan is the actual money you borrow, and the <a href=\"/blog/mortgages-explained/\">mortgage</a> is the document that describes all the conditions of the loan, including the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loan amount.</li>\n<li>Interest rate.</li>\n<li>Term.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In reality, people use “home loan” and “mortgage” interchangeably. You might hear someone say that they’re “paying their mortgage” when in fact they’re paying the home loan described in the mortgage note. Don’t worry, your bank isn’t going to mince words as long as you're paying everything on time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeownersneedahomeloan\">When do homeowners need a home loan?</h2>\n<p>In June 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics\">median price of a house reached $363,300</a>, according to the National Association of Realtors. That’s more than most of us have in savings, so home loans are common for just about anyone buying a house. Where you get the loan from can vary. While most people go to a bank or credit union for a loan, they can also have a seller-backed financing agreement that is privately executed. This is where the seller extends credit to the buyer.</p>\n<p>Home loans must be secured prior to the close of escrow. Most people get pre-approved for a loan so that their purchase offer is taken seriously and escrow has fewer hiccups, but this isn’t always the case. Ultimately, you need your home loan to fund prior to the close of escrow so that the title can transfer according to the purchase agreement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"qualifyingforahomeloan\">Qualifying for a home loan</h2>\n<p>Loan requirements vary from lender to lender and from loan type to loan type, but all require both income verification and creditworthiness. Here are some of the basic requirements for common home loan types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>US Federal Housing Administration (FHA):</strong> <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">To get an FHA loan</a>, you need a minimum credit score of 500 and a 10 percent down payment, but a 580 and 3.5 percent down is. You also need a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) capped at 31 percent for the front-end (just the home loan payment) and 43 percent for the back-end (all debt payments including the home loan)</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA):</strong> While the VA doesn’t set a minimum credit score for getting a home loan, the private lenders that offer the loans often require a minimum score of 620. There are no down payment requirements, and your back-end DTI cannot exceed 41 percent unless you meet the residual income test.</li>\n<li><strong>US Department of Agriculture:</strong> A USDA loan is designated for approved rural areas and has no down payment requirement. The minimum credit score is set by lenders and is often 640 or higher. The front-end DTI needs to be 29 percent or lower while the back-end DTI can’t exceed 41 percent.</li>\n<li><strong>Conventional home loans</strong>: These loans typically require a minimum of 3 percent down with a credit score of at least 620. Generally speaking, the DTI must be 45 percent or lower but can be bumped up for people with higher credit scores or financial reserves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/how-to-buy-a-house-with-no-money-down/\">No-money-down home loans</a> can seem like a great deal because you don’t have to save up for a hefty down payment. However, you need to look at your current situation and long-term goals to know if they’re the right option for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisahomeloanpreapproval\">What is a home loan pre-approval?</h2>\n<p>Pre-approval for a home loan means the lender has agreed that you qualify for a loan of a certain amount under certain terms. You have met the credit and income requirements and your DTI is in the approved ranges. The only thing missing is the actual property you are buying.</p>\n<p>A pre-approval letter indicates that a lender is willing to a specific amount so you can make an offer on a house. This gives the seller confidence that you are qualified to buy the property, and the transaction can move forward.</p>\n<p>The lender will still need an <a href=\"/glossary/appraisal/\">appraisal</a> performed on the property to ensure that the value of the home is appropriate for the amount you’re borrowing. If the appraisal is below the amount the lender has approved, you may need to renegotiate the price of the home, pay more up front, or walk away from the property because the loan won’t be funded.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisahomewarranty\">What is a home warranty?</h2>\n<p>Home warranty companies offer contracts stating they’ll pay for repairs to appliances and systems in your home. Say your refrigerator stops working. If you have a home warranty, you can call the company’s customer service line, and it will send a technician to fix your refrigerator. Some warranty companies may pay for a new one (or at least part of a new one) if your appliance is unfixable.</p>\n<p>Home warranties, of course, are not free. As the homeowner, you pay a monthly amount for the warranty, typically between $40 and $80. You will also pay a trade service fee (TSF) whenever you make a claim. The trade service fee, also called a service call fee, works a lot like a deductible. You pay the TSF, and the warranty company sends a technician to diagnose the problem and covers the repair cost up to the warranty contract limits.</p>\n<p>You should also note that home warranties usually only cover repairs of your home systems and appliances if they’ve been properly maintained. For example, your warranty may not pay out on a malfunctioning dishwasher if the technician discovers rust on its covered components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homewarrantyvshomeinsurance\">Home Warranty vs home insurance</h3>\n<p>Home warranties don’t replace <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. Instead, they pay for problems most homeowners face but that home insurance doesn’t address. A homeowners insurance policy pays for damages resulting from things like fire, theft, and windstorms, but it doesn’t cover repairs if a system like your HVAC breaks down or an appliance malfunctions. These are the kind of issues that a home warranty covers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesahomewarrantycover\">What does a home warranty cover?</h2>\n<p>While each home warranty company has its own set of coverages depending on the plan you choose, most cover your home’s systems and appliances as long as they’ve been properly maintained. Some have different plans that cover one or the other; others may offer plans that cover both. And many offer optional add-ons for an additional charge.</p>\n<p>In systems portion of a home warranty, you can often expect to find coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HVACs.</li>\n<li>Air conditioners.</li>\n<li>Furnaces.</li>\n<li>Plumbing.</li>\n<li>Electrical systems.</li>\n<li>Water heater.</li>\n<li>Ductwork.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for appliances, you can usually get coverage for your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Washer.</li>\n<li>Dryer.</li>\n<li>Garbage disposal.</li>\n<li>Refrigerator.</li>\n<li>Stove or oven.</li>\n<li>Built-in microwave.</li>\n<li>Dishwasher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some home warranties cover the following as part of a standard plan or in an add-on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swimming pool pumps.</li>\n<li>Hot tubs.</li>\n<li>Ceiling fans.</li>\n<li>Garage door openers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When purchasing a home warranty, you should review what each plan offers to make certain that your areas of concern are covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendohomeownersneedahomewarranty\">When do homeowners need a home warranty?</h2>\n<p>You need to have a home warranty prior to having a problem with a system or appliance for the coverage to kick in. So if your garbage disposal is broken at the time you purchase a home warranty, the company won’t pay to repair or replace it. In fact, most home warranty companies have at least a 30-day waiting period before you can make a claim.</p>\n<p>People typically buy a home warranty plan when they buy a house. This covers them for any unforeseen problems with systems and appliances once they move in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isahomewarrantyworthit\">Is a home warranty worth it?</h2>\n<p>Whether or not a home warranty is worth it depends on your situation. For example, you may want a home warranty if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have limited savings for repairs.</li>\n<li>You don’t want to make repairs on your own.</li>\n<li>You don’t want the hassle of <a href=\"/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-home-improvement-contractor/\">hiring a contractor</a>.</li>\n<li>You have expensive appliances.</li>\n<li>The person buying your home has doubts about the condition of your home’s systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, the requirement that your systems and appliances must be properly maintained has been a perennial sticking point for many homeowners. This may be the result of a home warranty company being less than honest, but it can also be a simple matter of a homeowner disagreeing with their company’s definition of property maintained.</p>\n<p>Either way, you may want to consider putting the money you would have spent on a home warranty into a savings account earmarked for repairs. While you won’t have the luxury of someone else taking care of your problem, you will have cash on hand for emergencies.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisahurricanedeductible\">What is a hurricane deductible?</h2>\n<p>Like an auto, health, or <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">home insurance deductible</a>, a hurricane deductible is the amount of money you pay out of pocket before your insurance benefits kick in to cover a claim. If you live in an area prone to hurricanes, like Florida, your home insurance will have two deductibles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The standard deductible</strong>. This is the amount you owe when you make a claim for fire, non-hurricane wind or hail, theft, or vandalism damage to the home or your personal belongings.</li>\n<li><strong>The hurricane deductible</strong>. This is the amount you owe when you make a claim to <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">cover hurricane-related wind</a> or hail damage to the home or your personal property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whendohurricanedeductiblesapply\">When do hurricane deductibles apply?</h2>\n<p>In general, wind damage incurred during specific weather conditions and timeframes trigger your hurricane deductible. A hurricane is generally defined as a windstorm of 74 miles an hour or more that touches ground. When the National Weather Service “names” a storm, that’s typically when your hurricane deductible will apply.</p>\n<p>Timing is also a factor in triggering hurricane deductibles. For example, the hurricane deductible may apply if the damage occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 24 hours before the storm is named or a hurricane makes landfall.</li>\n<li>Up to 72 hours after the hurricane is downgraded to a lesser storm or a hurricane watch is cancelled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurers and states may have their own hurricane deductible requirements, so ask your provider for clarification. For example, hurricane deductibles on <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> apply to windstorm losses that occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the National Weather Service declares a hurricane.</li>\n<li>During a hurricane watch or warning anywhere in Florida.</li>\n<li>Up to 72 hours after the watch or warning ends.</li>\n<li>During a hurricane season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To illustrate why these triggers matter, consider Hurricane Sandy. Homeowners across the East Coast were saved perhaps billions of dollars in out-of-pocket damage costs because it was downgraded to a “tropical storm” before it made landfall.</p>\n<p>Lastly, keep in mind that hurricane coverage doesn’t address flood damage from storm surges — you must have <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> for that protection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmucharehurricanedeductibles\">How much are hurricane deductibles?</h2>\n<p>Hurricane deductibles are a percentage of the coverage you have for your home or a flat dollar amount. For example, we offer a <strong>$500</strong> deductible, or deductibles that are <strong>1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, or 10%</strong> of your home's dwelling coverage.</p>\n<p>So if you have a 3% hurricane deductible and $300,000 in dwelling coverage for your home, you’d be responsible for the first $9,000 worth of hurricane damage. Your policy can usually cover the rest, depending on its coverage limits and restrictions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtochooseahurricanedeductible\">How to choose a hurricane deductible</h2>\n<p>Hurricane damage is usually extensive. Even though a $9,000 deductible may seem steep, it pales in comparison to the cost of rebuilding your home from the ground up without the financial help hurricane coverage offers.</p>\n<p>When choosing your hurricane deductible, keep in mind that the higher the deductible you choose, the lower your premium may be. If your home has certified <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">windstorm mitigation</a> features, such as window shutters, hurricane rated doors, and braced walls and roofs, you might consider a higher deductible because your loss risk is reduced. However, as with any deductible, make sure you select an amount you could reasonably pay in an emergency. Your insurance is only useful if you can use it.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatishurricanescreenenclosureinsurance\">What Is hurricane screen enclosure insurance?</h2>\n<p>Hurricane screen enclosure insurance pays to repair or replace your screen enclosure’s frame if it’s damaged during a hurricane. Basic <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> generally doesn’t cover this damage even when the policy includes <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to add on hurricane screen enclosure insurance if you live in a hurricane-ready area like Florida. Screen enclosures run anywhere from <a href=\"https://homeguide.com/costs/pool-enclosure-cost\">$5 to $15 per square foot</a> – up to about $14,000, depending on the size of the pool. This coverage is an inexpensive way to protect your investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchscreenenclosurecoveragecanyouadd\">How much screen enclosure coverage can you add?</h2>\n<p>Hurricane screen enclosure coverage is typically available in $5,000 increments up to $50,000. You usually won’t insure the screen enclosure at its exact construction cost because the coverage is for the frame itself, not the screening.</p>\n<p>While the coverage is usually just for the actual structure, that can vary among insurance companies. Some insurers will also provide coverage for the screens themselves in the event that a tree branch or something else penetrates the vulnerable screens or netting.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Florida, Kin covers hurricane screen enclosures on their actual cost value, not their replacement cost value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesyourdeductibleapply\">Does your deductible apply?</h2>\n<p>Yes, when you use your screen enclosure coverage, your <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> applies. This is especially worth noting if you only have damage to the screen enclosure after a hurricane. In cases like that, you may want to get an estimate of damage before filing a claim to make sure it costs more than your deductible. Your coverage won’t kick in otherwise.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"/faq/when-to-file-a-claim/\">when to file a claim (and when not to)</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"thebasicsofinsurableinterest\">The basics of insurable interest</h2>\n<p>To have an insurable interest means you have some sort of financial stake in the subject matter of a policy (i.e., person or thing being insured). For example, you have an insurable interest in your home because you would experience a financial loss if the house or belongings were destroyed or damaged.</p>\n<p>Another way to think about it is whether or not the person looking to buy a policy would have to pay for a loss if they didn’t get insurance. The need to come up with cash demonstrates that person’s insurable interest in the property. If someone doesn’t have a financial interest in the house, there is no insurable interest.</p>\n<p>You have to have an insurable interest in the thing to insure it. In other words, you can’t buy a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance policy</a> on your neighbor’s house. Even if you did, the policy would be unenforceable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurableinterestexamples\">Insurable interest examples</h2>\n<p>Insurable interest must exist for a policy to be underwritten. This is true for any insurance policy, including homeowners, business, and life insurance. A person can have an insurable interest in the life of a spouse who earns the family’s income. If the spouse were to die, that person would be without the spouse’s income to support – that’s an insurable interest.</p>\n<p>When it comes to homeowners insurance, the question is “Who stands to lose financially if the home is lost or destroyed?” You, the homeowner, clearly stands to lose money. But in some cases, another party may be affected, such as a mortgage company.</p>\n<p>This is why mortgage companies almost always require borrowers to buy homeowners insurance. Your mortgage company could be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars or more if your house suffers a total loss without insurance. It’s also why you may receive a claim payment check made payable to both you and your mortgage company. That way, your mortgage lender knows its interest in your home is maintained.</p>\n<p>But your mortgage company doesn’t have an insurable interest in everything that’s covered in your homeowners policy, only the physical structure. Your personal belongings, such as clothes and electronics, yours alone so a claim payment for those items come solely to you.</p>\n<p>You should note that your insurance company will notify your mortgage lender if you cancel your homeowners policy and don’t obtain new insurance while the lender still has an insurable interest in your home. Your lender also has the authority to purchase home insurance for your property and add the cost of the coverage to mortgage payments..</p>\n<h2 id=\"howaninsurableinterestappearsonhomeownerspolicy\">How an insurable interest appears on homeowners policy</h2>\n<p>Parties with an insurable interest in your home are listed on the insurance policy in most cases, and you can usually find them on your <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations pages</a>. As the homeowner and policyholder, you're listed as a named insured. Family members who live in the house are also covered, although they may not be individually named. Some insurers only include a spouse if the spouse’s name is on the deed.</p>\n<p>Your lender, or anyone else with an insurable interest, also appears on your declarations page, often as an <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insured</a> or a loss payee. This allows them to protect their interest in the property but does not make them liable for premiums or allow them to control coverages or make changes to the policy.</p>\n<p>When a party has an insurable interest in a property, they often request proof of insurance that shows that they are protected against losses. This is usually accomplished by sending them a certificate of insurance to demonstrate that you’ve named them as either a loss payee or an additional insured.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsuranceagent\">What is an insurance agent?</h2>\n<p>Most people think of an insurance agent as the person who sells insurance. That’s a decent insurance agent definition, but it’s important to note that an agent signs a contract to represent an insurance carrier. As a representative of a carrier, an insurance agent has the authority to sell its policies and bind the coverage –&nbsp;essentially confirm it’s in force. In return, the carrier gives the agent a sales quota and pays them a commission</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best way to think of an insurance agent is as an extension of the insurance carrier. The insurance agent's purpose is to drive business to the insurance carrier they represent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"captiveagentsvsindependentagents\">Captive agents vs. independent agents</h3>\n<p>There are actually two types of insurance agents: captive and independent. A captive agent works for just one insurance company as either a full-time employee or an independent contractor. Captive agents usually get administrative and sales support from the carrier that hires them, but they can’t sell policies from other carriers. In fact, they also don’t even have access to other carriers’ information so they can’t give their clients quotes to compare.</p>\n<p>Independent insurance agents can work with more than one insurance carrier. Like captive agents, independents sign contracts with carriers, so they also act on behalf of the insurance companies and not the consumer. Because they usually contract with multiple carriers, independent agents are better able to offer their clients a choice between policies with different coverage benefits and premiums.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisaninsurancebroker\">What is an insurance broker?</h3>\n<p>If you’re shopping for insurance, you may have also come across insurance brokers. They’re also intermediaries between consumers and carriers, but the <a href=\"/blog/difference-between-insurance-agent-and-broker/\">difference between insurance agents and brokers</a> is who they work for. While agents work on behalf of the insurance carriers they contract with, brokers represent the consumer or business seeking insurance. In fact, brokers owe a fiduciary duty to their clients.</p>\n<p>Even independent agents who can contract with several carriers work on behalf of the insurance carrier. Brokers, on the other hand, look for the best policy on the market to fit the needs of the consumer. Because they don’t represent an insurance carrier, brokers can’t bind an insurance policy. Instead, they locate the best policy and then submit an application to the insurance carrier for approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoinsuranceagentsmakemoney\">How do insurance agents make money?</h2>\n<p>Both insurance agents and brokers make a living by earning commissions on the policies they sell. Unfortunately, this drives up the costs of the insurance. Think about the commission paid to an agent. It might be anywhere from six to 12 percent or more from the carrier which factors that cost into the premium it charges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsofbuyinginsurancedirectlyfromthecarrier\">Benefits of buying insurance directly from the carrier</h2>\n<p>Rather than going through an agent or broker, consumers can buy insurance directly with many <a href=\"/glossary/admitted-carrier/\">carriers</a>. And there’s a good reason to do so: cost-savings. Insurance carriers don’t have to pay commissions when you buy directly from them, and sometimes they pass that savings on to you.</p>\n<p>Saving money is certainly the biggest plus to buying policies directly from an insurance carrier. But there are other benefits to consider as well, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Carrier knowledge:</strong> Many independent agents represent multiple carriers, and it’s easy to mix up the details about one carrier with another. When you work directly with the carrier, you can be sure you’re getting the correct information.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear intentions:</strong> Insurance agents’ commissions vary by carrier and policy, and that gives them an incentive to push certain products. If you shop directly with a carrier, you won’t have a representative recommend a policy simply because it improves their compensation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Direct-to-consumer options can save you money on your homeowners insurance, but you still want to work with a quality carrier with representatives that can make sure you’re getting the appropriate coverage.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsurancebinder\">What is an insurance binder?</h2>\n<p>When you purchase insurance, you often need to wait for the insurance company to issue a policy that outlines the details of the contract, such as what’s covered, what’s excluded, how long the coverage lasts. This often happens because the insurer’s underwriting department still has to review your application.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you sometimes need evidence that you’ve purchased a policy, so your insurance company sends you an insurance binder. That way, you can show that you paid for a policy and an insurance company has agreed to cover your risk.</p>\n<p>Binders are not fully written insurance contracts. In fact, not all details about the policy are provided in a binder. Much of the policy terms and conditions are presumed. However, insurance binders are enforceable contracts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisincludedinaninsurancebinder\">What is included in an insurance binder?</h2>\n<p>For an insurance binder to be valid, it must contain certain information. Usually, they list only the most pertinent details about the coverage. Most binders include the following seven key elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1risk\">1. Risk</h3>\n<p>The risk is the insured asset, or basically whatever is at risk of being lost. In the case of <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, the risk is the home that is being insured. This is often identified by the address of the home. For a risk such as a car, the year, make, and model would be listed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2liabilitycoverage\">2. Liability coverage</h3>\n<p>The binder should list the amount of liability coverage the policy has. This often starts at $100,000 but can go as high as $1 million or more on some policies. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Liability insurance</a> covers your legal costs if a third party claims you’re responsible for their property damage or injuries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3limitsanddeductibles\">3. Limits and deductibles</h3>\n<p>Coverage limits are often listed in the binder along, as are <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductibles</a>. On a home insurance binder you should see limits listed for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>, personal property coverage, and any medical payments or loss of use limits purchased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4nameoftheinsureds\">4. Name of the insureds</h3>\n<p>As an enforceable contract, the binder must state who gets the benefits of the policy. The most obvious example is the named insured, which simply means a person explicitly mentioned in the policy. But policies can also have <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insureds</a>, or people who are added to your coverage. Homeowners often add their mortgage company to their coverage as an additional insured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5insurancecompanyname\">5. Insurance company name</h3>\n<p>This may seem obvious, but a binder must name the insurance company offering coverage. Along with the insurance company name, the binder lists the type of coverage purchased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6policyterm\">6. Policy term</h3>\n<p>Binders often include the policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a> and its expiration date. Because binders are temporary, some also include their own expiration dates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7agentname\">7. Agent name</h3>\n<p>Agents have the authority to bind coverage, which means they can confirm coverage is in place. Because they can do this, agents are usually listed on the binder. That way, the insurance carrier knows who’s representing the policyholders and who submitted the initial application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyisaninsurancebinderimportant\">Why is an insurance binder important?</h2>\n<p>Insurance binders are important because other parties often have an interest in the risk that a policy covers. Anyone who loans money for a major purchase is an example of someone who has an interest in a risk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insurancebinderexample\">Insurance binder example</h3>\n<p>Your mortgage lender probably required you to get home insurance before they’d approve your loan. This is because your lender wants to know that the house is protected from day one.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsuranceendorsement\">What is an insurance endorsement?</h2>\n<p>An insurance endorsement, also called a rider, is simply an amendment to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> policy. An endorsement can add, remove, exclude, or limit your coverage. Most folks add endorsements to homeowners insurance to increase coverage or limits for their dwelling, belongings, and personal liability.</p>\n<p>Riders can be added to a policy at the time of purchase, renewal, or mid policy term. They must be added to an existing policy; they can’t be purchased as a standalone insurance product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdoesaninsuranceendorsementdo\">What does an insurance endorsement do?</h3>\n<p>Think of an insurance endorsement as any change that impacts how your policy protects you and your home. That means an endorsement can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add coverage to your policy.</strong> For example, this type of endorsement may increase the amount of mold coverage your policy offers.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit or exclude coverage in your policy.</strong> This type of endorsement reduces coverage. You may opt for this type of endorsement if you had a coverage in place you no longer need. Otherwise, some insurers may mandate these endorsements because of underwriting restrictions. For example, some of our competitors reduce or exclude hurricane wind coverage or limit liability to your premises.</li>\n<li><strong>Add or remove people and addresses from your policy.</strong> Think of this as an administrative endorsement. This type of endorsement updates the language in your policy to reflect your current realities: mortgagees, named insureds, address, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on what the endorsement does, your premium may increase, decrease, or not change at all.</p>\n<p>For example, if an endorsement is added to change the mortgagee on your policy, that alone would not impact your premium.</p>\n<p>But if you opt for an endorsement that increases your dwelling coverage, for example, that would likely increase your premium. Similarly, an endorsement that decreases that coverage would likely decrease your premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"popularhomeownersinsuranceendorsements\">Popular homeowners insurance endorsements</h2>\n<p>These common insurance endorsements are an easy way to customize and add coverage to your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodcoverage\">Flood coverage</h3>\n<p>At Kin, we offer <a href=\"/home-insurance/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> as a simple add-on to your policy so your home is protected for damage caused by storm surges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"animalliabilitycoverage\">Animal liability coverage</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">animal liability endorsement</a> helps pay for injuries and property damage caused by your fluffy friends.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hurricanescreenenclosure\">Hurricane screen enclosure</h3>\n<p>Screened enclosures are an investment – it makes sense to add coverage that protects them.

    body: "<h2 id=\"insurancelapsedefinition\">Insurance lapse definition</h2>\n<p>Every insurance policy is underwritten for a term, or the period when the coverage is in force. When the term ends without the policy being renewed or canceled, the policy has lapsed. Sometimes a policy lapses because the policyholder didn’t do anything when they got their renewal notice. However, many insurance companies automatically renew coverage, so this is less likely to happen this way.</p>\n<p>The more common reason for a lapsed policy is unpaid premium. If you fail to pay your premium monthly, then your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> may lapse prior to its expiration date. That means all the contractual commitments made by your insurance company no longer exist. Basically, an insurance lapse means you are now uninsured, even if only for a short while.</p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> might also cancel your policy if you misrepresent yourself on your insurance application. And insurance companies have been known to change their underwriting guidelines, decide your home is too risky to insure, and send you a <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">non-renewal notice</a>. These situations can also cause an insurance lapse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcanalapsedpolicyhurthomeowners\">How can a lapsed policy hurt homeowners?</h2>\n<p>A lapsed policy leaves you without coverage, and that could be devastating if you experience damage before you get new insurance. Your insurer isn’t obligated to pay <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claims</a> during a lapse, so you’ll have to pay the costs of any damages on your own.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an insurance lapse may mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your premiums will go up.</li>\n<li>Other insurance companies won’t want to insure your home.</li>\n<li>Your mortgage company will buy more expensive coverage on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Insurance companies have to notify you if they plan on canceling or not renewing your home insurance, and most provide a 30-day <a href=\"/glossary/grace-period/\">grace period</a> for nonpayment. These give you an opportunity to take action. In the case of a non-renewal or cancellation, you most likely need to find a new company that can provide coverage so you don’t have a lapse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoavoidaninsurancelapse\">How to avoid an insurance lapse</h2>\n<p>The best way to avoid a lapse in coverage is to pay your insurance premium regularly. You might also want to sign up for a payment plan where your premium is automatically deducted from your checking account or put on a credit card. Then you don’t have to remember to pay your bill, and you can prevent any errors from delaying your payment.</p>\n<p>You also want to respond to all notices your insurance company sends. While insurance companies are notorious for sending out a ton of paperwork, their notices may alert you to any trouble that could lead to a lapsed policy. Most insurance lapses can be avoided if you deal with them prior to or during a grace period. This is the best way to avoid a lapse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetinsuranceafteralapse\">How to get insurance after a lapse</h2>\n<p>A lengthy gap in coverage increases your chances of having a claim occur while you’re uninsured. This makes it important to get new coverage as soon as possible if your policy lapses. Start by checking with your home insurance provider to see if your coverage can be reinstated. If not, then it’s time to call other insurance companies to get new quotes for coverage. Do this even if you plan to contest your insurer’s actions.</p>\n<p>After you get a few quotes, you need to apply for and purchase coverage. One of the most important steps here is to set an immediate <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a> so your insurance coverage kicks in right away. Otherwise, you’re simply extending the time when you don’t have coverage.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you have a mortgage, then you’re probably required to maintain continuous home insurance. If you don’t, your mortgage company might purchase a policy and send you the bill. Policies purchased by a mortgage company are notoriously more expensive than what you could purchase on your own.</p>\n<p>While a lapse is seldom a good thing, it doesn’t mean your home is uninsurable.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisamoratorium\">What is a moratorium?</h2>\n<p>A moratorium, also known as a binding prohibition, is when an insurance company stops issuing or updating policies because of an impending disaster. These often go into effect before a major storm, like a <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricane</a>.</p>\n<p>An insurance moratorium is designed to keep folks from buying (and canceling) coverage based on the forecast. Homeowners need coverage that anticipates their risks year round, not just when the weather seems especially dicey.</p>\n<p>You may be impacted by a moratorium if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to switch insurance companies.</li>\n<li>You want to buy a policy.</li>\n<li>You want to change coverage to your existing policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're already insured and don't want to make any policy changes, a moratorium won't impact you.</p>\n<p>Because you never know when disaster will strike, you want your policy to be ready for what comes next. Don't wait to get the appropriate coverage.</p>\n<p>If you wait too long – especially during <a href=\"/insurance-resources/hurricane-updates/\">hurricane season</a> – you may run into a moratorium and you’d have to wait until it’s lifted to get or change coverage. And you don’t want to be caught between policies or with inadequate coverage when a big storm hits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whendoinsurancemoratoriumshappen\">When do insurance moratoriums happen?</h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, moratoriums happen anywhere from <strong>24 to 48 hours</strong> before an expected event. Moratoriums can be put in effect for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hurricanes</li>\n<li>Wildfires</li>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n<li>Riots or civil unrest</li>\n<li>Floods</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some instances, moratoriums are only in place for certain counties or regions. Other times, they are put in place for the entire state. It depends on the situation and its projected impact.</p>\n<p>Every insurance company individually decides when to put a moratorium in place, so the timeline varies. This means you might not be able to get insurance from one insurer but could from another who hasn’t placed a moratorium yet.</p>\n<p>But most will hit pause when a widespread threat is near. Usually within days of a storm making landfall, most insurance companies will not issue new policies or change the coverage on existing ones.</p>\n<p>It’s also possible for a moratorium to last after an incident occurs, such as an earthquake in <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California</a>. Aftershocks can come days after a major earthquake and cause more damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdomoratoriumswork\">How do moratoriums work?</h3>\n<p>So what happens if you call an insurance company for a new policy and hear that a moratorium exists? You can still apply for insurance, but your new coverage won’t begin until the moratorium is lifted and the policy is bound. Any losses during this downtime would <em>not</em> be covered by the policy.</p>\n<p>A moratorium can affect policies that are already in force, too, if you were hoping to change it. During the moratorium, you likely won’t be able to change a deductible from $5,000 to $1,000. You also won’t be able to add or remove coverages. The moratorium effectively maintains what an insurance company currently has on the books.</p>\n<p>If your policy is set to <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">not renew</a> and would have expired during the moratorium, some companies will extend coverage during this time and bill for the additional days of protection.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don’t let your policy lapse and hope for the best. Talk to your insurance company and see what can be done to keep your home safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongdoesamoratoriumlast\">How long does a moratorium last?</h2>\n<p>A moratorium will last as long as there is imminent danger. They remain in effect until the risk has passed. This timeline can vary drastically from event to event.</p>\n<p>For example, if a hurricane rages through a community, the bulk of damage is known when the storm passes. However, there may be flooding for days after the storm. An insurance company may wait until all effects of the storm have passed before it lifts the moratorium.</p>\n<p>Typically, it’s fair to expect a moratorium to last several days after the event passes. Some companies may take longer than others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifyoureinthemiddleofbuyingapolicywhenamoratoriumhits\">What happens if you’re in the middle of buying a policy when a moratorium hits?</h3>\n<p>So now you know you can’t buy your policy during a moratorium. But is there an exception if you’re closing on a house during this time? Or if you had to wait to buy your policy because you needed an <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">inspection</a>? Does the moratorium count if you started the process <em>before</em> the moratorium began?</p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately, there are no exceptions with moratoriums.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re closing on a home, the “<a href=\"https://www.pothandassociates.com/blog/can-hurricane-or-named-storm-affect-my-closing/\">force majeure</a>” clause will likely go into effect and put escrow on hold. In fact, your loan will usually not fund during this time, either. Everything is put on hold because if your new home is damaged, it will need to be fixed to meet the final home inspection and appraisal amount to preserve your existing loan and insurance.</p>\n<p>If you were in the middle of buying coverage, <strong>don't cancel your existing policy until you have a new policy in place</strong>. This prevents any gaps in insurance coverage when the unexpected happens – like a moratorium. After the moratorium passes, you can resume purchasing your new policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you buy flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), you won’t be subjected to a moratorium, but you will have to wait 30 days before your coverage starts. If you buy <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> from us, though, your coverage takes effect as soon as it’s bound, but can’t be purchased during a moratorium.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gettinginsuranceafterastorm\">Getting insurance after a storm</h3>\n<p>When the moratorium is lifted, you can purchase your policy. Keep in mind that the quote you got prior to the storm and moratorium might change after if your property was damaged.</p>\n<p>If you made it through the event unscathed, reach out to your insurance company to get your new policy squared away.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsurancepolicy\">What is an insurance policy?</h2>\n<p>When you buy insurance, you’re actually paying for your insurance company’s promise that it will take care of certain costs should something catastrophic occur. Your insurance policy explains the details of that promise as well as your responsibilities as the policyholder.

HO3 is the name of the form most insurance companies use to create a homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>An insurance policy is also a contract of adhesion. That means it’s an agreement between two parties where one party has more power than the other. In the case of an insurance policy, your insurance company controls the terms and conditions, and you have little power to negotiate for better terms. Courts tend to look closely at adhesion contracts because of this power imbalance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreadyourhomeinsurancepolicy\">How to read your home insurance policy</h2>\n<p>Insurance policies contain a lot of information﹘and much of it is written in legalese that can be difficult to decipher. For that reason alone, most people don’t look past the <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. But your dec page is actually a fairly good summary of what your home insurance policy covers, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage limits.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">Effective date</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">Deductible</a>.</li>\n<li>Premium.</li>\n<li>Discounts.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">Endorsements</a>.</li>\n<li>Policy number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of that is useful when you need basic details, like when you’re filing a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a> or comparing coverage before you renew your policy. However, you need to dig deeper into your insurance policy’s language if you really want to understand what it covers.</p>\n<p>An easy way to start is to get familiar with the different sections found in most homeowners insurance policies. After the declarations page, you can usually find the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definitions.</strong> Insurance policies usually have a section where key terms are defined. For example, your homeowners policy most likely defines concepts like named insured, insured location, bodily injury, and property damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Insuring agreement.</strong> Most homeowners policies have a broad statement that describes the agreement between you and your insurance company ﹘essentially, that it provides insurance that follows the provisions outlined in the policy in return for your premium. That statement is then narrowed down by what’s described in the subsequent sections.</li>\n<li><strong>Property coverages.</strong> This section describes what property is covered and in what circumstances your policy pays claims on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use</a> coverages and your responsibilities as an insured. If you have an HO3 policy, then it also lists the specific perils that aren’t included.</li>\n<li><strong>Liability coverages.</strong> Similar to the property coverage section, this explains the scope of <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Coverage E</a> and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Coverage F</a>, what’s included and excluded, and your responsibilities as an insured.</li>\n<li><strong>Endorsements.</strong> Any changes you make to your coverage typically appear on the pages towards the end of your insurance policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding what’s in your homeowners insurance policy is key to making sure you have the coverage you need. For example, let’s say you live in a <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a> and are required to have flood coverage. You skim through the property coverages in your homeowners policy to the information on exclusions. There you discover that you aren’t covered for flooding so you decide to buy <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"insurancepremiumdefinition\">Insurance premium definition</h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever owned an insurance policy, you likely know that an insurance premium is what you pay to your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> in order to have insurance. The amount is typically a yearly figure, but it can often be paid monthly. The agent who sold you the policy probably quoted you a premium, but you can also find it on your policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declaration page</a>.</p>\n<p>People can have different home insurance premiums even when they live right next door to one another. This is because insurance premiums are based on a slew of factors, many of which are unique to the homeowner and their home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoinsurancepremiumswork\">How do insurance premiums work?</h2>\n<p>When you buy insurance, say <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, you usually have to complete an application that asks several questions. The answers to many of these questions help the insurance company decide how risky your home is to insure, whether it can cover that risk, and how much premium to charge.</p>\n<p>For example, home insurance companies usually want to know your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address.</li>\n<li>Square footage.</li>\n<li>Age.</li>\n<li>Building materials.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">Roof shape</a>.</li>\n<li>Safety features.</li>\n<li>Upgrades and renovations.</li>\n<li>Prior claims.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But they also need details about you, such as your birthdate, Social Security number, and insurance history. All together, this information gives the insurance company some insight on the likelihood of you filing an insurance claim. That risk is ultimately what determines your home insurance premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howkincalculateshomeinsurancepremiums\">How Kin calculates home insurance premiums</h2>\n<p>Most insurance companies have actuaries review your information and enter it into algorithms to determine your premiums. And to get it, they usually make you fill out long applications.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to home insurance applications, we think <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-questions/\">the fewer questions, the better</a>. Instead, we use technology to comb public records and pull much of the information we need to evaluate your risk. That way, you can apply and get covered quicker and with fewer complications than you would with other insurance companies.</p>\n<p>The information we get from public sources is often more accurate than what an applicant might know. In turn, this makes our home insurance premiums more accurate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoinsurersdowithinsurancepremiums\">What do insurers do with insurance premiums?</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies may use premiums to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay claims.</li>\n<li>Cover administration costs.</li>\n<li>Grow their assets through investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By investing some of their premiums, insurance companies mitigate costs to policyholders and prepare for catastrophic claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoinsurancepremiumsgoupatrenewal\">Why do insurance premiums go up at renewal?</h2>\n<p>Home insurance premiums do periodically go up when you renew your policy, and there are a few reasons why. We’ve listed three common ones below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your insurer has to account for inflation.</strong> A good example of this happened in April 2021 when inflation caused <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">lumber prices to skyrocket</a>. That and other rising construction costs forced insurance companies to change their <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-estimate/\">replacement cost estimates</a> for homes. Ultimately, that led to more expensive premiums upon renewal for many homeowners.</li>\n<li><strong>Your insurer has more claims than expected.</strong> Insurance companies collect insurance premiums to cover the cost of claims, but an onslaught of catastrophic claims may mean they have to raise their rates.</li>\n<li><strong>You had more claims than expected.</strong> Your home insurance premium is based on what your insurance company thinks is your chance of filing claims. If you prove your insurer wrong with either more severe or more frequent claims than it planned on paying, then it may raise your rates to more accurately represent your risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtoloweryourhomeinsurancepremium\">How to lower your home insurance premium</h2>\n<p>There are several ways you may be able to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">keep home insurance premiums down</a>. For example, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask about discounts.</strong> Many insurance companies offer discounts for home maintenance you might already be doing.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid filing small insurance claims</strong>. Only using your home insurance for damage you can’t cover on your own is a good way to keep your premium down.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay your entire insurance premium upfront.</strong> Your insurer may offer monthly or semi-annual payment plans, but they often charge a fee when they do.</li>\n<li><strong>Opt for a higher deductible.</strong> A higher <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> can lower your insurance premium. Just be sure you opt for an amount you can afford to cover if you have a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">Get a quote</a> to see how much you can save on your home insurance premium with Kin.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsurancequote\">What is an insurance quote?</h2>\n<p>Before you can get an insurance policy, you first have to complete an application with an insurance company. The insurance company takes the information on your application and runs it through an algorithm that calculates what it costs to insure you. From this, the company generates an estimate for your premium. That estimate is your insurance quote.</p>\n<p>Your quote tells you approximately what it costs for you to get a policy with that particular insurance company. Most companies send insurance quotes that include details about the policy you hope to buy. For example, a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> quote may list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The limits for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>.</li>\n<li>Your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>.</li>\n<li>Any <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> you’ve added to your policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’re not bound by an insurance quote. You can choose to take your business elsewhere or continue working with the company that provided the estimate.</p>\n<p>If you do choose to buy a policy from the company that offered the quote, then the company moves forward with processing your coverage. This includes underwriting, where individuals review the details you provided on your application to make sure nothing has changed and that the premium is appropriate for your risk. Sometimes the underwriting review reveals information that changes your quote, such as a credit problem, additional hazard, or a prior claim. This is a fairly common situation and usually the difference is minimal.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you thought you had an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a> three years ago, so you put that information on your home insurance application. You get your insurance quote and decide to move forward with buying the coverage. However, the insurance company’s underwriter discovers that the claim actually occurred four years ago. This changes how the insurance company interprets your risk and may result in a lower final premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedifferencebetweenquoteandpolicy\">The difference between quote and policy</h2>\n<p>There’s a big difference between quote and policy in insurance. In fact, the quote comes before the policy can even exist. And while a quote may include some coverage basics, it is not the actual contract. Your policy, however, is the contract that defines your coverage. Without a policy, you don’t have insurance.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there’s a bit of a lag between when your insurance policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a> and when you have your policy in hand. To bridge that gap, insurance companies often provide you with an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-binder/\">insurance binder</a>. Binders are temporary but enforceable coverage that you can use as proof of insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetanaccurateinsurancequote\">How to get an accurate insurance quote</h2>\n<p>Because an insurance quote can change before you buy the policy, you want to make sure that you get as accurate of a quote as possible. That requires giving the insurance company’s representative as much information as possible and keeping it accurate and truthful.</p>\n<p>For example, if you say that your house is made of wood on your application, then you’ll get a quote based on that. But your premium will change if underwriting finds that your house is made of bricks. This is one reason we use technology to scour public records. Not only do we end up with the most precise information available, but we’ve also managed to make insurance applications <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-questions/\">shorter and easier to complete</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtocomparehomeinsurancequotes\">How to compare home insurance quotes</h2>\n<p>Getting just one quote from one insurance company isn’t the best way to shop for insurance. You’re usually better off requesting quotes from several companies before you decide. But when you do, make sure you’re comparing more than just the cost. Coverage details can have a major impact on the value of your policy, so you also want to look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coverage limits.</strong> Your dwelling coverage limits have a direct impact on your premium. Plus, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">loss of use</a>, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a> limits are typically percentages of your dwelling coverage, and the available percentage can vary by insurance company.</li>\n<li><strong>Valuation.</strong> We use your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> when we determine your insurance quote. That’s usually preferable than using its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> that accounts for depreciation.</li>\n<li><strong>Covered perils.</strong> Some home insurance is written on an open perils basis, which means it covers any <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> except those explicitly mentioned as excluded. But insurance companies can also offer named-risk policies that only cover the events listed in the contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These aren’t the only features to consider. You also want to pick an insurance company that offers <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">good discounts</a>, great service and an easy claims process. Those are things you usually find out after you get an insurance quote and buy a policy, but looking at online reviews for the <a href=\"/best-home-insurance/\">best home insurance companies</a> can help.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisahomeinsurancerenewal\">What is a home insurance renewal?</h2>\n<p>Like most Insurance renewals, a home insurance renewal is when you decide if you want to continue your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> for another term. Most home insurance policy terms are a year, so your insurance renewal date is one year after your <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a>. However, your provider needs to notify you that your renewal is coming up by sending you an insurance renewal letter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theinsurancepolicyrenewalprocess\">The insurance policy renewal process</h2>\n<p>In a lot of situations, insurance renewals happen automatically. That’s certainly true of most home insurance renewals. But even if your insurance company renews automatically, it’s usually legally required to notify you beforehand. The laws governing this practice vary by state, but most policyholders get a renewal letter a month or so prior to their policy’s expiration date.</p>\n<p>An insurance renewal letter typically includes information about your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">Deductible</a>.</li>\n<li>Coverage amounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> may change if construction costs go up in your area because that makes it more expensive to rebuild after a catastrophic event. That increase may also impact your premium.</p>\n<p>Once you receive a home insurance renewal letter, you can either accept your insurance company's offer or shop around for a new <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">policy</a>. Doing nothing generally means you accept the offer and your insurance company renews your coverage. But if you decide not to renew, then you need to contact your insurer. Some may need your cancellation notice in writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancerenewalchecklist\">Home insurance renewal checklist</h2>\n<p>One reason you get your insurance renewal letter a month before your expiration date is so you have time to dig into the new policy. You’ll want to look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Changes to your premium.</strong> Your rate may go up or down depending on events that occur during the life of your previous policy. Some you don’t have much control over, like inflation or or an increased exposure to risk. But the claims you file can also impact your costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Coverage adjustments.</strong> Your dwelling coverage may adjust with construction costs, but that’s not the only way your coverage might change. Your insurer might add exclusions in some cases. And remember that <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use</a>, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a> limits are percentages of Coverage A, so modifying your dwelling coverage affects the others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also need to let your insurer know of any changes in your situation, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home remodeling projects.</li>\n<li>Newly purchased valuables.</li>\n<li>Updates to your roof.</li>\n<li>Changes to your wealth.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">new dog</a>.</li>\n<li>A new security system.</li>\n<li>Any new family members or roommates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few of these changes may mean you need to pay a higher premium, like a remodeling project that adds square footage to your home. Not disclosing them, however, could mean claims are denied later on. Moreover, certain upgrades, like a new roof or burglar alarm, may reduce your costs. Either way, make an appointment with your insurance agent to discuss your renewal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howcanilowermyhomeinsurancepremiums\">How can I lower my home insurance premiums?</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance premiums don’t always go up at a renewal, but when they do, it can be frustrating for policyholders. If you’re in that situation, here are a couple of steps you can take that may help you get a lower premium:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask about discounts.</strong> Most insurance companies offer <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a> for actions that benefit them, like signing up for paperless policies or installing security systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase your deductible.</strong> A higher deductible means you pay more in a claim, so choose an amount that fits your budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for a new insurance company.</strong> Every insurance company has its own way of determining price, so you may find a more affordable policy if you shop around.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you decide to look for a new insurance company, use the details on your renewal letter to compare offers. You also want to lock in your new coverage and alert your insurance company that you’re canceling before your old policy expires. That way you avoid spending any time uninsured.</p>\n<p>And as long as you're shopping for home insurance, <a href=\"https://welcome.kin.com/start\">get a quote from us</a>!</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatinsuredmeans\">What insured means</h2>\n<p>The insured is the person, group of people, or entity who benefits from an insurance policy. Usually, the insured has a risk of being financially burdened if something damages the item covered by the policy. This risk, also called an <a href=\"/glossary/insurable-interest/\">insurable interest</a>, is why the insured needs protection. The coverage is there to protect the insured from financial loss.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say that a homeowner has a fire that causes $50,000 in damages. Without <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, the homeowner would have to pay for all of the repairs out of pocket. But this homeowner bought coverage, so they’re an insured on a policy. This means their insurance carrier pays the claim on their behalf.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoqualifiesasaninsured\">Who qualifies as an insured?</h2>\n<p>In almost all cases, the insured is the policyholder﹘essentially, the person who purchased and controls the policy﹘but there are instances where an insured is not the policyholder. Life insurance policies, for instance, are often bought by one individual but insure someone else, such as a spouse or a business partner.</p>\n<p>The insureds on a homeowners policy also typically include family members living in your home. Most policies define the insured as the named insured, the named insured’s spouse, dependent children, and other dependents. For example, spouses are usually insureds on a homeowners policy, as are biological and adopted children.</p>\n<p>You should note that a long-term significant other might not be automatically considered an insured on your home insurance. Depending on your state’s laws, a live-in partner may not fit the definition of a spouse. Similarly, roommates are usually only considered insureds if they are related to you by blood.</p>\n<h3 id=\"insuredexample\">Insured example</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you have a child who lives in your home. The child hits a baseball and accidentally breaks your neighbor's window. As an insured, your child’s liability is most likely covered by your home insurance, so your insurance carrier pays for the broken window.</p>\n<p>But what happens when that child grows up and goes to college? In many situations, homeowners insurance still covers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a>.</li>\n<li>Their <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical expenses</a> for guests injured in their dorm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Policies typically continue to cover college students who are under the age of 24 and who live on campus. But every policy is different, so you should talk to your agent to make sure your college-age student is covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"namedinsuredvsadditionalinsured\">Named insured vs. additional insured</h2>\n<p>As we’ve discussed, insurance companies typically consider family members living in your house to be insureds. However, only some of those people can be named insureds, or the people specifically named in your policy as having coverage. The primary example of a named insured is the homeowner (i.e., the person whose name is on the deed). This person’s name also appears on the policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declaration page</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">Additional insured</a> are other people or entities who aren’t assumed to be covered by your homeowners’ insurance but who have a financial interest in your home. An additional insured might be a live-in partner whose property and liability need protecting or a sibling who helped you buy your home but lives elsewhere. As the named insured, you can add them to your policy.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaninsurer\">What is an insurer?</h2>\n<p>Every insurance contract, or policy, involves at least two parties: the insurer and the insured. The insurer is the party, usually a company, that develops insurance policies, offers quotes, and underwrites the coverage. The insured is the person who’s covered by and receives the benefits of the policy. If the insured suffers a loss, then the insurer pays the claim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theinsurersroleingettingquotes\">The insurer’s role in getting quotes</h3>\n<p>One of the first interactions you may have with an insurer when buying a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> is getting a quote. This process usually begins with an application so the insurer can obtain basic information about you and your home. Your answers help the insurer determine your overall risk and set an appropriate premium.</p>\n<p>Quotes are generally quick to obtain, but may change slightly when the policy gets closer to being issued. The difference happens when the insurer’s underwriting department digs into the risks of your house to make sure it knows as much as it can about your property and its occupants. Changes to your quote should be brought to your attention and thoroughly explained.</p>\n<p>You can obtain a quote in a matter of minutes, but binding and issuing a policy (i.e., confirming coverage and sending you a copy) can take a few days to complete. You should also note that many quotes come with expiration dates. If you don’t move forward with your insurer by that date, then you may have to apply for coverage again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theinsurersroleinmanagingyourpolicy\">The insurer’s role in managing your policy</h3>\n<p>When you buy insurance, your insurer sends you a copy of your policy and <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declaration page</a> as well as bill statements showing how much premium you owe. Your insurer is also responsible for providing you with the mechanisms to manage your policy. Usually, this means that it has representatives to take payments, update your information, and make changes to coverage, but online options for these policy management tasks are becoming more common.</p>\n<p>Your insurer is required to send you a renewal notice prior to your policy’s term coming to date. Insurance renewals happen automatically, but your insurer has to let in advance so you can decide if you need to change your coverage. For example, if you made renovations to your home or got married during your policy term, you may actually need more higher limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theinsurersroleinclaims\">The insurer’s role in claims</h3>\n<p>One of the most important things that your insurer does is administer the <a href=\"/claims/\">claims process</a>. Most insurers have specialized departments that handle claims exclusively. When a claim arises, your insurer’s claims department takes your initial information, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your policy number.</li>\n<li>A brief description of the event.</li>\n<li>Documentation of the damage, including videos or photos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The claims department opens and assigns an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">adjuster</a> to your account who works with you to fix damage and replace irreparable items. The adjuster reviews the details of your claim and may even visit your property to assess damage. They often ask additional questions that help them determine the cause and total value of your loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"insurervsinsuredwhatsthedifference\">Insurer vs. insured: What's the difference?</h2>\n<p>The main difference between the insurer and insured is their roles in an insurance contract. Insurers offer the policies that insureds buy. Both parties have to adhere to the contract terms and conditions. For instance, the insured has to pay premiums and maintain certain behaviors that lower risk, while the insurer must process and pay claims if a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">covered peril</a> causes damage. Insurance policies are subject to renewal and an insurer can cancel or <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">choose to not renew a policy</a> if an insured doesn’t pay premium, doesn’t maintain the home properly, or has too many claims.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisajewelryappraisal\">What is a jewelry appraisal?</h2>\n<p>Most simply, a jewelry appraisal is an evaluation of what your jewelry is worth. You hire an appraiser who inspects your item, looking for key characteristics that may affect the price, such as metal type, gemstones, and other significant aspects of the item’s design. Once finished, the appraiser gives you an appraisal certificate. This certificate confirms the value of the item and acts as proof that you are its owner.</p>\n<p>Jewelry appraisals for insurance need to list your jewelry’s measurable and verifiable characteristics, such as its:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight.</li>\n<li>Gemstone grades.</li>\n<li>Diamond grades, cuts, and clarity ratings.</li>\n<li>Metal type.</li>\n<li>Style.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jewelry appraisals should also list your name and contact information as well as the date of the appraisal. All of this needs to be printed on the appraiser’s letterhead. Getting an appraisal allows you to get the protection you desire for an added premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoineedajewelryappraisalforinsurance\">Why do I need a jewelry appraisal for insurance?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> generally only insure jewelry, watches included, up to a set amount ﹘ usually between $1,000 and $2,000. That’s fine if you have one nice piece, but it might not cover a collection of valuable watches or one heirloom necklace. To make sure your high-end jewelry is covered, you most likely need <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property coverage</a>.</p>\n<p>But jewelry values can fluctuate, so your diamond ring may be worth more than what you originally paid. Moreover, your insurance company can’t just take your word on what your items are worth. Otherwise, the company risks being scammed by a nefarious person who insures their cheap jewelry for more than it's worth, only to “lose” the item and collect the insurance. A professional jewelry appraisal makes sure both parties know what’s being insured is worth the insurance being purchased.</p>\n<p>Many insurance companies accept a jewelry appraisal performed within a certain period. So if you change insurers, an appraisal from last year might be good enough. Be sure to mention your valuables and your most recent appraisal when getting a quote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoigetajewelryappraisal\">How do I get a jewelry appraisal?</h2>\n<p>To get an appraisal, you need to go to a professional appraiser. Unfortunately, there are no licenses for appraisers, so you do need to do some research. You can start at jewelry stores or auction houses. Next, make sure that the appraiser is certified with one of the following organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://old.appraisers.org/Home\">American Society of Appraisers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.isa-appraisers.org/\">International Society of Appraisers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://najaappraisers.com/\">National Association of Jewelry Appraisers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’ll need to have the item you want appraised with you, and you will most likely have to hand it over to the appraiser for a few days, if not a couple of weeks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesareceiptworkasmyjewelryappraisal\">Does a receipt work as my jewelry appraisal?</h2>\n<p>Receipts sometimes work as a jewelry appraisal for insurance companies, but not always. Your insurance company wants to know the value of the piece because it needs to know what it costs to replace your jewelry if it’s lost or damaged. A recent receipt ﹘ say within the past 12 to 24 months ﹘ is often fine, especially if it includes details that demonstrate the item’s value.</p>\n<p>However, keep in mind that fluctuating values may mean what you paid might not match the cost to replace your item. Even a recent receipt may not sufficiently cover the cost of replacement if you got a good deal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesajewelryappraisalcost\">How much does a jewelry appraisal cost?</h2>\n<p>The cost varies, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $150 per hour for a jewelry appraisal, but some appraisers charge a flat fee and can tell you their price upfront. More unique items, such as heirloom or custom-made pieces, may require a quote from your appraiser.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatislaworordinancecoverage\">What is law or ordinance coverage?</h2>\n<p>Most standard homeowners insurance policies include a clause that states that the insurer will not cover the costs associated with the enforcement of any ordinance or law which regulates the use, construction, repair and demolition (including removal of debris) of any property after an insured event has occurred.</p>\n<p>Ordinance or law coverage therefore applies if you are faced with having to rebuild your home after a covered loss and are required by ordinance to upgrade the rebuild to meet current building codes. Such codes include construction, electrical, plumbing, fire safety etc. An example of changing building codes is evident in the significant transformation of construction practices in earthquake, hurricane, and flood zones.</p>\n<p>It’s a scary thought but a real possibility – if your home suffers from a loss event, local ordinances may increase the costs to repair, demolish, or rebuild your home by a staggering 50 percent. This could have a significant impact on your out of pocket expenses. Ordinance or law coverage is designed to assist in protecting you from these increased costs and is valid whether you suffer a partial or total loss to your home or other structures.</p>\n<p>Three types of coverage are included in ordinance or law insurance:</p>\n<p><strong>Loss to the undamaged portion of the building</strong></p>\n<p>Covers the loss of value of the undamaged portion of the building when demolishment is required in order to comply with current building code requirements</p>\n<p><strong>Demolition cost</strong></p>\n<p>Where the law requires the undamaged portions of the covered building to be demolished, the Demolition Cost coverage will cover the cost to demolish and remove the debris</p>\n<p><strong>Increased cost of construction</strong></p>\n<p>This coverage will cover the increased cost to repair or rebuild the damaged building as well as to repair or rebuild the undamaged portion of the building (regardless of whether demolition is required or not), as long as the damage was causes by an otherwise covered cause of loss.</p>\n<p>When deciding if this coverage is necessary for you, consider the age of your home. The older your home the more susceptible it is to building code upgrades in the event of a covered loss. If you suspect your home was built according to out-of-date building requirements, it is highly recommended that you purchase Ordinance or Law coverage. Depending on which state you live in, you are able to select Ordinance or Law Coverage limits based on certain percentages of your Main Structure insured value.</p>\n<p>Don’t be caught out at the time of a claim. If you are unsure as to whether you require Ordinance or Law coverage, it may be worth seeking advice from a builder or home inspector to ensure you adequately protect yourself from significant financial loss should you be faced with such a scenario.</p>"

But the limit of liability on <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures' coverage</a> is usually a percentage of the dwelling coverage ﹘ often about 10 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesalimitofliabilitymeanforahomeowner\">What does a limit of liability mean for a homeowner?</h2>\n<p>You want to understand the limits of liability on a homeowners policy before you buy it because they tell you if you have enough insurance. Once you hit your policy’s limits in a claim, your insurance company has met its responsibility and will not pay anything else. That leaves you to cover whatever is left.</p>\n<p>First, make sure you’re getting enough dwelling coverage to rebuild your home in a complete loss. Next, check the limits on the other structures, personal property, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a>. These are typically percentages of your dwelling coverage, so you want to decide if you’re comfortable with each amount. For instance, review your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a> limit to see if it covers the majority of your belongings.</p>\n<p>Finally, you want to pick a limit for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>. We usually recommend homeowners get about $100,000 for personal liability, but you may need a higher limit if you have a high net worth or own an <a href=\"/blog/attractive-nuisance/\">attractive nuisance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherecanifindthelimitsofliability\">Where can I find the limits of liability?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a> of your insurance policy lists the six coverages with your insurer’s limits of liability next to them. For example, you may see your personal liability coverage with $100,000 listed next to it. This means your insurance company’s limit of liability is $100,000, and it will pay claims up to that amount as long as the details fit what’s outlined in your policy. Your insurer typically pays for your defense and covers court awards if you’re sued, but only up to its limit of liability.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your policy may have special limits of liability for certain items, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jewelry.</li>\n<li>Firearms.</li>\n<li>Money.</li>\n<li>Electronics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For high-value items like these, your policy may only cover a specified amount, sometimes only $1,500. That may not be enough for expensive items, so you may need a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property endorsement</a> or an additional insurance policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caniincreasethelimitsofliabilityonmyhomeinsurance\">Can I increase the limits of liability on my home insurance?</h2>\n<p>You may have the option to increase certain limits in your insurance policy. The dwelling limit is one that you might be able to increase, but many insurers discourage it. They use a proprietary formula to determine their limit of liability, so if your home was properly underwritten, then you're paying the correct premium.</p>\n<p>However, there may be situations where upping the limits of liability on your home insurance makes sense. Let’s say you have a full guest house on the property. Then the default limits on the other structures coverage may not be enough. The same may be true for the personal liability limit. People often increase that limit as their income and assets increase because they have a greater risk for lawsuits.</p>"

However, the market value of a home is much more apparent when you want to sell it. That’s when real estate agents consider the current market conditions and attributes of the home and compare these to the sale prices of comparable homes in the area to determine a list price. This list price reflects what the real estate agent and the homeowner feel is the fair market value of the home.</p>\n<p>But the list price is only one part of determining the market value of a home because buyers also have a say in what they think the property is worth. As a result, you may receive offers that meet, exceed, or fall short of the list price. The amount that buyers are willing to pay, and it puts your home’s market value in sharper focus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"marketvaluemeaningforinsurance\">Market value meaning for insurance</h2>\n<p>Many homeowners think they need enough <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> to cover the market value of their home, but that’s not the figure insurance companies use when they determine your coverage limits. Instead, your insurance company uses your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This is the amount it takes to rebuild your home from the ground up.</p>\n<p>These can be two very different numbers because each considers different factors. For instance, market value takes into account the supply and demand of the housing market and the value of the land your home sits on. Replacement cost doesn’t look at either of these, but does factor in rebuilding costs, like construction, labor, demolition, and debris removal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"marketvaluevsreplacementcostexample\">Market value vs. replacement cost example</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you purchase a home in a seller’s market for more than the list price, paying $500,000.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisamoralhazardininsurance\">What is a moral hazard in insurance?</h2>\n<p>In insurance, a moral hazard is when the person covered by a policy has an incentive to take risks they wouldn’t if they were uninsured. The idea is that getting coverage might discourage a homeowner from taking reasonable and prudent actions to protect their home and belongings because they know the insurance company will pay for damages.</p>\n<p>For example, a homeowner who has insurance may be less likely to lock their doors because they know that the insurance company covers their stolen property. Not locking doors increases their chances of a loss, but the homeowner is less concerned because they aren’t the ones that have to pay.</p>\n<p>Looking at it that way, it’s probably not a surprise that the term “moral hazard” originated in the insurance industry, or that it continues to be an issue for insurance companies to this day. It’s one reason some <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> hesitate to offer coverage to certain types of risks, like vacant buildings. The owner of a vacant building may not have an incentive to protect it – or may even see an economic advantage to burning it down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moralhazardinsuranceexample\">Moral hazard: Insurance example</h2>\n<p>Bikes are often used as examples of moral hazards for insurance because they are usually included in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a>, are used outside the home, and are often the target of theft. If you buy a bike and don’t have coverage (or don’t realize that your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> covers it) you’re more likely to be vigilant about locking it up in safe locations. But someone who knows that insurance will replace the bike might decide that locking it is unnecessary and a waste of time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howinsurancecompanieshandlemoralhazards\">How insurance companies handle moral hazards</h2>\n<p>Your insurance company can’t control whether or not you lock your bike, but it can create incentives for you to behave in a way that’s more responsible. In homeowners insurance, one of those incentives is the <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. This is the amount the policyholder is responsible for in a claim. By requiring homeowners to choose a deductible of anywhere from $500 to $2,000 or more, insurance companies increase the likelihood of homeowners taking better care of their property, and this mitigates the insurance company’s risk.</p>\n<p>Another way your insurance company encourages responsible behavior and limits its losses is through <a href=\"/glossary/exclusion/\">exclusions</a>. For example, most home insurance policies exclude damage resulting from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor home maintenance.</li>\n<li>Regular wear and tear.</li>\n<li>Pest infestations.</li>\n<li>Gradual leaks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, say you discover a beam under your deck has started to rot, but you put off fixing it. Over time, the situation gets worse, the beam fails, and your deck collapses. Your insurance company may deny your claim because your damages are the result of a maintenance issue.</p>\n<p>By denying claims like these, your insurance company encourages homeowners to perform routine maintenance to ensure there are no problems with their homes’ plumbing, electrical, or other systems.</p>\n<p>Many insurance companies go a step further to reduce the impact of a moral hazard in insurance policies by offering <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts for customers who exhibit safer behaviors</a>. These might include discounts for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting a security system.</li>\n<li>Installing a fire alarm.</li>\n<li>Buying a water leak detection device.</li>\n<li>Upgrading your roof.</li>\n<li>Living in a gated community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might also be offered a discount if your insurance history is free of claims. The hope here is that you’ll only file a claim when absolutely necessary because you want to keep the discount.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whoisanamedinsured\">Who is a named insured?</h2>\n<p>An insured is simply a person, business, or other entity that an insurance policy covers. A named insured, however, is unique in that they are specifically mentioned in the policy. Usually, the named insured is the only person or entity covered by every section of the policy.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the named insured is the policyholder, or the person who purchased the policy. That’s typically how it works in <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. The homeowner purchases home insurance and is the named insured because they have the <a href=\"/glossary/insurable-interest/\">insurable interest</a> in the property. Many homeowners policies also include the owner’s spouse and family members living in the home as named insureds.</p>\n<p>But this isn’t the case with every type of insurance. For example, a life insurance policy can be purchased by one person, making them the policyholder, but insure the life of someone else. The person’s life who is insured is the named insured.</p>\n<p>You can find out who is a named insured by reading the policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. Each named insured is typically listed there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesanamedinsureddo\">What does a named insured do?</h2>\n<p>On a homeowners policy, the named insured usually has control of the policy. That means they can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change coverage limits.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.</li>\n<li>Cancel the policy.</li>\n<li>File <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claims</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Named insureds also have certain obligations. For example, they’re typically responsible for paying premiums, reporting losses immediately, and assisting their insurance provider when it investigates claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsofbeinganamedinsured\">Benefits of being a named insured</h2>\n<p>The main benefit of being a named insured is that you’re covered by every aspect of your homeowners policy. That means you control the policy, and you get the proceeds if you have to file a claim. So if your house and personal items are lost in a fire, you can file a claim with your insurance company. Your insurer then evaluates your claim, determines how much you lost, and covers the cost to rebuild your home and replace your personal property.</p>\n<p>Your insurance company may pay you directly to cover your personal property, but it could send the check to the contractors who are fixing your home. If you do receive the claim check, then the check might also list your mortgage lender as a recipient to make sure that the proceeds are, in fact, used to fix the home. Your insurer can do this if your mortgage lender is listed as a loss payee on your coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"namedinsuredvsadditionalinsured\">Named insured vs. additional insured</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance policy may also list <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insureds</a>. These are individuals or entities who aren’t included in your policy, but that you want to have covered. Common reasons for adding an additional insured to your homeowners policy include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get married.</li>\n<li>Someone owns part of your home but doesn't live there.</li>\n<li>Someone who isn’t a member of your immediate family moves in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The biggest difference between named insureds and additional insureds is who controls the policy, and that’s the named insured. For comparison, additional insureds are people the named insured adds to their policy, and that status means they have limited rights and responsibilities. For example, additional insureds are not responsible for paying premiums, but they can benefit your insurance company’s duty to defend insureds during a liability claim.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisthenationalfloodinsuranceprogramnfip\">What is the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)?</h2>\n<p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a nationally run flood insurance provider. Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover floods, so the program is intended to be an option that fills that gap. It’s managed by FEMA to reduce the socio-economic impact of floods.</p>\n<p>More than 5 million homeowners in over 23,000 vulnerable communities have flood coverage through the NFIP. Overall, the <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/IF10988.pdf\">program protects more than $1.3 trillion in property</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywasthenationalfloodinsuranceprogramcreated\">Why was the National Flood Insurance Program created?</h2>\n<p>The NFIP was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The purpose was to reduce the financial burden of floods in communities across the United States. One part of the act establishes a flood insurance program, one part produces a flood risk map, and one enforces floodplain management standards for the most at-risk communities.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the act, insurance policies underwritten by the NFIP are subsidized by FEMA. Its purpose was to help the most at-risk communities have access to affordable flood insurance. It also encourages the communities it works with to adopt flood mitigation measures through floodplain management. This might be city drainage work, levy maintenance, or homeowner education.</p>\n<p>Flood insurance is required for homes and buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas, as designated by FEMA’s flood maps. That’s because these areas are more likely to face floods, and flooding is super expensive. <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1532084396868-6f7ea45df92a644aa1a9126b55ceaf50/8.5x11_1_inch_flyer.pdf\">According to FEMA</a>, just an inch of water can cause $25,000 in restoration work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesanationalfloodinsuranceprogrampolicycover\">What does a National Flood Insurance Program policy cover?</h2>\n<p>The NFIP underwrites flood insurance policies through a network of insurance agents. It covers losses resulting from a rise in water from external sources, like ocean storm surge, overflowing rivers and lakes, or heavy rain that doesn’t drain properly. Flood insurance also covers the accumulation of water from melting snow.</p>\n<p>These policies cover the structure and the contents of the home up to $250,000 and $100,000 respectively.</p>\n<p>The policy has a 30-day waiting period before coverage takes effect, though it can be waived to meet loan requirements for a new home purchase. In that instance, the policy becomes effective the day after purchase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesntanationalfloodinsuranceprogrampolicycover\">What doesn’t a National Flood Insurance Program policy cover?</h2>\n<p>While the NFIP flood policy covers a rise in water from external sources, it doesn’t cover all rises in water. Sewer backups are not covered unless they are part of a bigger flooding issue. Isolated flooding on one person’s property may not be covered, either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isthenfiptheonlyoptionforfloodinsurance\">Is the NFIP the only option for flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>No. Many homeowners mistakenly think that the only flood insurance available is through the National Flood Insurance Program. In fact, many private insurance companies like Kin offer <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-private-flood-insurance/\">private flood insurance</a>. In many cases, it’s cheaper, too.</p>\n<p>Private flood insurance also tends to be more robust than that offered by the NFIP. Whereas the NFIP limits coverage to $250,000 for the structure and $100,000 for contents, private flood insurance often has full property coverage. That means the structure’s flood coverage matches <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">coverage A</a> in the homeowners insurance policy.</p>\n<p>If your home’s replacement cost exceeds $250,000, an NFIP policy may leave you underinsured in the event of a total loss. The same is true for the $100,000 property coverage limit.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisnegligence\">What is negligence?</h2>\n<p>Every day, you’re presented with situations that require us to act, and if you fail to act in a reasonable way, you can be accused of negligence. For example, it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that a reasonable homeowner who sees ice on their sidewalk would understand that someone might slip on it. A negligent homeowner, however, doesn’t do anything to remedy the situation.</p>\n<p>Essentially, negligence is acting in a way that no reasonable person would act, disregarding prudence and safe practices. In insurance, these actions often lead to losses and costly claim. Someone might be considered negligent if they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fail to care for trees on their lot so one crashes on their neighbor’s home.</li>\n<li>Forget to turn off their faucet and causes water damage in the apartment below.</li>\n<li>Leave a door unlocked, allowing their house to be burglarized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note in these examples that sometimes negligence harms your property, but it can just as easily cause property damage for someone else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grossnegligencevsnegligence\">Gross negligence vs. negligence</h3>\n<p>When you’re talking about negligence in insurance, you want to distinguish between negligence and gross negligence. The law essentially expects you to act reasonably all the time, but it also accounts for the fact that people make mistakes. While those mistakes can cause harm, the people who commit them usually don't intend to hurt anyone. Those are the kind of mistakes that are usually classified as plain, old negligence.</p>\n<p>But there’s another level of negligence called “gross negligence,” and it describes behavior that is reckless or shows an extreme disregard for the safety of others. A common example happens with pets. In some states, you may be considered grossly negligent If you know your dog is vicious and you don’t take steps to protect others from attack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"negligenceininsuranceclaims\">Negligence in insurance claims</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies do consider negligence when evaluating claims. For example, if there’s a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">Coverage E</a>, your insurance company evaluates to what degree your negligence played a role in the other party’s property damage or physical injury. Depending on what the investigation reveals, your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> then pays all, some, or none of the damages.</p>\n<p>Every insurance policy is different, and many have exclusions that limit coverage depending on how negligent you are. Damage caused by an honest mistake, like accidentally throwing a frisbee through your neighbor’s living room window, is most likely covered. But throwing a rock﹘even accidentally﹘might not be covered because a reasonable person could probably see how that was going to end.</p>\n<p>You should also note that having a claim paid doesn’t necessarily mean everything’s good with your insurer. Repeated claims stemming from your negligence may cause your insurance company <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">not to renew your policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a> most likely requires you to take reasonable care of your property, so your insurer will typically deny claims if it thinks you were negligent in maintaining your home. Let’s say there’s a pipe leaking in your home that you do nothing about and end up with mold behind your walls. Most home insurance has limited coverage for mold, but your insurance company probably won’t pay because you were negligent about taking care of the leak.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies exclude negligence in home maintenance to protect against a moral hazard. A moral hazard is the chance the insurance company takes that you’ll take more risks with your home because you’re protected by home insurance. By refusing to pay for your negligence, the insurance company creates an incentive for you to take care of your house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3keyfactsaboutnegligenceininsurance\">3 key facts about negligence in insurance</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, your homeowners insurance covers your negligence when it harms someone outside of your household, but not when it damages your home. But there are some other interesting coverage details about negligence in insurance that may be helpful to know, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intentional acts are not covered.</strong> Accidents happen, and that’s what insurance is for, but insurance companies seldom, if ever, cover willful bad conduct.</li>\n<li><strong>Your family is covered wherever they go.</strong> Homeowners insurance often helps pay for other mistakes you make out in the world. One limitation here is car accidents. For that, you need auto insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Your insurance company may cover fraudulent claims.</strong> Say your neighbor lies about slipping on your icy driveway. Your insurer most likely has a duty to defend you if they sue.</li>\n</ul>"

You may be asked to submit a no loss statement if your policy lapsed or was canceled or if you applied for coverage during a moratorium. Your insurer will need this statement before they move forward with reinstating or issuing your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whenwouldyouneedtosignanolossstatement\">When would you need to sign a no loss statement?</h3>\n<p>There are two situations when your insurance company may ask for a no loss statement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your policy lapsed or was canceled but is being reinstated.</strong> Rather than creating a new application, a brand new policy, and a new effective date, your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> may ask you to confirm you haven’t experienced losses while your policy was inactive. That way the company doesn’t have to assume responsibility for damage that happened while your home wasn’t in its care.</li>\n<li><strong>You applied for coverage right before a widespread disaster struck.</strong> If the company went into <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-moratorium/\">moratorium</a> before issuing the policy, you will be asked to sign a no loss statement once it’s lifted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both cases, you’re just affirming that at the time of signing, your home hasn’t experienced any damage that would trigger a claim.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all insurance companies will reinstate a policy once it’s lapsed! Having continuous coverage is the best way to ensure your home’s safety. Plus, lapsed policies may be subject to higher rates. Think about it this way: continuous coverage proves that you take your home’s protection seriously. To insurers, that means fewer losses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoinsurersaskforanolossstatement\">Why do insurers ask for a no loss statement?</h2>\n<p>It’s easier for both you and your insurance company to reinstate your existing policy. In our case, we already have all the data about your home, all the inspections we may need, and all your background information. We’d rather not waste your time or all that good underwriting work.</p>\n<p>But anything can happen between the time your policy lapsed and when it’s reinstated. Many accidents and damages happen without any warning, and your insurance company just wants confirmation that it’s not taking responsibility for a previous loss it has no way of knowing about.</p>\n<p>All said, no loss statements reduce the chance of <a href=\"/faq/avoid-contractor-fraud/\">insurance fraud</a>. If these statements didn’t exist, folks might only buy insurance right after they experience a loss. That would be unfair to the millions of homeowners who plan ahead for their home’s protection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exampleofanolossstatement\">Example of a no loss statement</h3>\n<p>You can see an <a href=\"/images/reports/no-loss-example.pdf\">example of our statement of no loss form here</a>.

    body: "<h2 id=\"howanoticeofnonrenewalinhomeownersinsuranceworks\">How a notice of nonrenewal in homeowners insurance works</h2>\n<p>When your insurance company decides not to renew your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, the nonrenewal only takes effect once the current policy ends. Every state requires companies to send a notice of a nonrenewal of homeowners insurance before the current policy expires, usually 30 days or more, so you have time to take action and make sure you remain insured.</p>\n<p>Nonrenewal notices usually also give you a reason that your insurance company will no longer insure your home. Usually, your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a> doesn’t want to renew your policy because your home no longer meets the company’s requirements, but you may also get a nonrenewal notice if your insurer no longer offers the same type of coverage. Knowing why your insurance company decided not to renew your policy can help you rectify the situation so you still have home insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"canceledvsnonrenewed\">Canceled vs. nonrenewed</h3>\n<p>Canceled and nonrenewed are both situations where you can wind up without home insurance, but the circumstances surrounding these events are different. “Canceled” means your policy is being terminated in the middle of the term. “Nonrenewal” means that your insurance company will no longer insure your home once your policy expires.</p>\n<p>In most states, your insurance company can only cancel your coverage in the first 60 days or if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You fail to pay the premium.</li>\n<li>The insurance company discovers you committed fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, an insurer may cancel your policy within the first 60 days if it discovers your home has more risk than they want to insure during underwriting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whencaninsurerssendnonrenewalnotices\">When can insurers send nonrenewal notices?</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies can decide to not renew policies when they have a legitimate business for doing so. Some examples of legitimate business reasons to send nonrenewal notices include an insurer deciding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It no longer wants to sell insurance in a state.</li>\n<li>To change its risk profile.</li>\n<li>To drop a specific type of policy.</li>\n<li>Certain homes are too expensive to insure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Florida is a prime example of a state where there are lots of nonrenewals. Climate change has made it difficult for insurance companies to cover losses, so many have had to send nonrenewal notices to their customers before leaving the state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyougetanonrenewalnotice\">What to do if you get a nonrenewal notice</h2>\n<p>Let’s say you get a nonrenewal notice for your homeowners insurance that says your roof is now too old and in disrepair. In that case, you might want to contact your insurance company to find out what needs to be fixed and if you have time to fix it. If you do, you may be able to make the repairs and get your insurance company to reconsider.</p>\n<p>But getting a nonrenewal notice that indicates your insurer has changed its risk profile is a little trickier. For example, your insurer might decide it won’t cover properties where certain <a href=\"/blog/restricted-breeds/\">types of dog breeds</a> live. No one can expect you to give up the family pet, so your current insurance company is probably a no-go. In that case, you may have to call different insurance companies until you find one that doesn’t have an issue with your dog’s breed.</p>\n<p>Nonrenewal notices give you time to either contest your insurer’s decision or find a new provider. But there are some instances where a policyholder's current insurance company nonrenews and no other company is willing to offer coverage. For homeowners, that often means going to a state-run program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipstopreventgettinganonrenewalnotice\">Tips to prevent getting a nonrenewal notice</h2>\n<p>There’s not much you can do if your insurance company changes its risk profile or leaves the state. But you may reduce your chances of getting a nonrenewal notice if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintain your property</strong>: Performing routine maintenance in and around your home is a good way to make claims less likely, so be sure to trim trees, keep your roof in good repair, and check for leaky pipes. The fewer claims you have, the more attractive risk you are for your insurance company.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase your deductible</strong>: Carrying a higher deductible may discourage you from making smaller claims. This means you maintain a positive claims history with your insurance company and don’t run the risk of too many claims.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn the claims history of your home</strong>: When you buy a new property, request a copy of its claims history from the <a href=\"https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com\">Consumer Loss Underwriting Exchange</a>. Certain types of claims, particularly those with water damage, can mean insurers see the home as a high risk. Knowing that can help you mitigate your own chances for trouble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do get a notice of nonrenewal, we encourage you to try getting a quote from us.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisanoccurrenceininsurance\">What is an occurrence in insurance?</h2>\n<p>Most people understand that an occurrence is a thing that happens, like bumping into an old friend or losing your wallet. But occurrence has an insurance definition, too. In insurance, an occurrence is an incident you're responsible for that leads to damages for someone who is not covered by your policy. When you have an occurrence while your homeowners insurance is active, then you need to alert your insurance company so it can help you pay for the damages.</p>\n<p>Only occurrences that happen during the policy term are covered by your insurance company. Any accidents outside of that period are your responsibility, and you have to pay to fix whatever has been damaged out of your own pocket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examplesofcommonoccurrencesinsurancecovers\">Examples of common occurrences insurance covers</h2>\n<p>Accidents and incidents happen in homes every day. As long as your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> is active, common occurrences like these are generally covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A child falls off your porch and breaks their arm</li>\n<li>A branch from your tree falls on your neighbor’s car</li>\n<li>A delivery driver slips on your icy walkway</li>\n<li>Your dog gets loose and bites your guest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these are examples of occurrences happening to a third party (i.e., someone who isn’t covered by your home insurance). When that happens, your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> kicks in to help pay for their injuries or property damage as well as your legal costs if they sue. Your home insurance may also have <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments coverage</a> to help you pay for the injured person’s immediate medical bills and reduce the chance of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>For an occurrence to be covered, it has to be an accident. Insurance companies aren’t in the business of paying for your bad behavior. The same goes for certain <a href=\"/glossary/negligence/\">negligent acts</a>. You want to act as a reasonable person would in a given situation to avoid having your <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a> denied for negligence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoafteranoccurrence\">What to do after an occurrence</h2>\n<p>The first thing you should do after any occurrence is to make sure the people involved are okay. Provide first aid to an injured person or get them to the emergency room if you need to. If there’s been property damage, let the property owner know so they can mitigate their damages.</p>\n<p>At this time you may want to document the occurrence. Note what happened and when, and if there are any witnesses to the event. You might want to take pictures of the damages and ask for copies of any police reports or immediate medical bills.</p>\n<p>Next, you need to file a claim with your insurance company. This usually has to be in writing, and many companies have online forms to make this process easier. If your insurance company doesn’t have an online form, then you may have to call it or your agent to get the ball rolling.</p>\n<p>Most insurance companies generally want to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your policy number.</li>\n<li>Your name.</li>\n<li>The time, place, and circumstances of the occurrence.</li>\n<li>The injured party’s name and address.</li>\n<li>Any witnesses’ names and addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a>, you have a duty to assist your insurance company with its investigation into the occurrence as well as your defense if you’re sued.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaperilininsurance\">What is a peril in insurance?</h2>\n<p>The definition of Insurance peril is any event, situation, or incident that causes property damage or loss. Fire, theft, wind, and vandalism are common perils that homeowners insurance can cover. It’s important to understand which perils your policy covers so you know when you should file an insurance claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areallperilscovered\">Are all perils covered?</h2>\n<p>No home insurance policy covers every single type of loss event. The type of policy you have determines how many perils are covered.</p>\n<p>Policies offer two types of coverage for perils: named perils or open perils (also called all risk).</p>\n<h3 id=\"namedperils\">Named perils</h3>\n<p>Policies that offer basic and broad coverage only cover perils that are named in the policy (this is also called named-perils coverage).</p>\n<p>Usually, named-perils policies cover loss or damage from these 16 events:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire or lightning</li>\n<li>Windstorm or hail</li>\n<li>Explosion</li>\n<li>Riot or civil commotion</li>\n<li>Aircraft</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Vandalism</li>\n<li>Theft</li>\n<li>Volcanic eruption</li>\n<li>Falling object</li>\n<li>Weight of ice, snow, or sleet</li>\n<li>Accidental water overflow or steam</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of certain household systems</li>\n<li>Freezing</li>\n<li>Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With a named-perils policy, you are only protected if the cause of a loss is one of these listed perils and it's not excluded by one of the named exclusions in the policy, and that leaves a lot of gaps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openperilsorallrisk\">Open perils or all risk</h3>\n<p>Open perils or all risk means all perils are covered except for those the policy lists as exclusions – the opposite of how named perils work. In an open-perils policy, more losses are covered, and you know exactly which aren't.</p>\n<p>Our policies offer open-perils coverage for your home and other structures so that you're protected for more types of loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whichperilsareexcludedfromanopenperilspolicy\">Which perils are excluded from an open perils policy?</h2>\n<p>Standard exclusions in an open-perils policy may vary from state to state, so look at your policy or ask one of our representative about your exclusions.</p>\n<p>In some cases, an excluded peril can be covered by your policy for an additional fee.</p>\n<p>That said, these perils are usually listed as exclusions in an open-perils policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth Movement</strong>\nThis includes earthquakes, sinkholes, landslides and others scenarios where the earth moves.</p>\n<p><strong>Flood and Water Damage</strong>\nThis includes surface water, sewer backup, overflow from sump pumps, and water below the ground that affects your foundation.

    body: "<h2 id=\"policytermmeaning\">Policy term meaning</h2>\n<p>An insurance policy is a contract that’s valid for a specific duration. That duration is called the policy term, and it can vary depending on the type of insurance you’re talking about. Policy terms for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> are often one year from the <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a>, or the day and time that coverage begins, but life insurance policy terms are typically longer.</p>\n<p>Whatever the length, you’re covered by the conditions detailed in the policy throughout the term. For example, your home insurance covers the cost of damage caused by <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> that occur during the policy term.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whypolicytermsmatter\">Why policy terms matter</h2>\n<p>Policy terms seem really simple, but there can be a lag between when you buy your policy and when it goes into effect. That’s particularly true with homeowners insurance, where you may need proof of insurance before you actually own a home. Let’s look at an example to see how that might happen.</p>\n<p>Imagine you’ve decided to buy a house and need to apply for a mortgage. Typically, your lender wants to know you have home insurance before it will offer a loan. But that means you need to insure a property you don’t even own.</p>\n<p>The solution is by getting insurance where the policy term begins on the date the title transfers to you. Essentially, you want your policy’s effective date to be the same as the date when you officially own the house.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathappenswhenapolicytermends\">What happens when a policy term ends?</h2>\n<p>When your policy term ends, your insurance contract expires. However, your insurance company has to send you a renewal notice to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let you know your policy term is ending.</li>\n<li>States any changes to your coverage or <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-premium-definition/\">premium</a>.</li>\n<li>Explains how to continue coverage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Renewal notices usually show up about four to six weeks prior to the end of your policy term. This gives you time to decide if you want to continue with your current insurer. If you decide to cancel, the early notice also gives you time to buy a new policy so you can avoid a <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-lapse/\">lapse</a>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, your insurance company may not give you the option to renew. In that case, you’ll get a non-renewal notice instead of a renewal letter. <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">Non-renewals</a> can happen for several reason, such as your insurance company:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stopped offering your policy.</li>\n<li>Is no longer licensed in your state.</li>\n<li>Changed the risks it's willing to cover.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, insurance companies have to notify you before the end of your policy term so you have time to find new coverage. How much time varies by state, but you usually get a non-renewal notice at least one month before your policy term expires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canicancelmypolicyduringmyterm\">Can I cancel my policy during my term?</h2>\n<p>You have the right to cancel your policy at any time. Plus, your premium is based on what it costs to insure you for the entire policy term, so your insurance company typically returns a portion of it to you. At least, that’s <a href=\"/faq/premium-refund/\">the way we do it</a>. Other insurance companies may charge penalties and fees if you cancel before your policy term expires.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canmyinsurancecompanycancelmycoverageduringmypolicyterm\">Can my insurance company cancel my coverage during my policy term?</h2>\n<p>Your insurance company can cancel your policy in a couple of situations. For example, it can cancel coverage for any reason during the first 60 days of the policy term. This might happen if it discovers an undisclosed risk like a swimming pool during final <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting</a>. After that, your insurance company can only cancel you for nonpayment of premium or you misrepresented information on your insurance application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caniadjustmypolicyterm\">Can I adjust my policy term?</h2>\n<p>You usually can’t shorten your policy term once coverage is in effect. However, you can cancel your coverage at any time. So say you’re flipping a house and only need insurance while you’re renovating. In that case, you may want to get a standard one-year policy and then cancel it when the home is no longer in your name. Similarly, you can’t make your policy last longer, but you can choose to renew it when your policy term is up. Just remember that your insurance company may adjust your coverage or premium at that time.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisapolicyholder\">What is a policyholder?</h2>\n<p>When you buy an insurance policy, you become the policyholder. This means you’re in charge of the coverage, so you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a>.</li>\n<li>File claims.</li>\n<li>Cancel the policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also means you’re responsible for paying premiums and helping your insurance company investigate claims.</p>\n<p>As the owner of a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners’ insurance policy</a>, you’re probably also the primary person insured by the policy, so you’re also protected under all of the policy’s coverage parts. That includes its dwelling, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, and liability coverages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"policyholdervsinsuredwhatsthedifference\">Policyholder vs. insured: What’s the difference?</h2>\n<p>Insurance professionals call the person who’s protected by a policy an <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a>. When you look at it that way, a policyholder is almost always an insured, especially if you’re talking about home insurance. In fact, you’re what insurance companies call a <a href=\"/glossary/named-insured/\">named insured</a>, which means you're specifically mentioned and covered by every aspect of your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>Another type of insured you might have on your homeowners policy is an <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insured</a>. These are people, companies, and organizations that you’ve added to your coverage. One common example of an additional insured for homeowners is their mortgage lender. Additional insureds do not have any control over the policy.</p>\n<p>You should also know that the named insured is not always the policyholder. For example, a person may take out life insurance on their spouse. The person taking out the policy is the policyholder and receives benefits, but the spouse is the insured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"otherinsuredsonyourhomeownerspolicy\">Other insureds on your homeowners policy</h3>\n<p>Not everyone in your household needs to be a named insured to benefit from your coverage. For example, your home insurance policy might cover your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spouse.</li>\n<li>Biological and adopted children under the age of 21.</li>\n<li>Immediate family members living in the home, such as your parents or siblings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note we’ve included your spouse on the list of other insureds. Many insurers automatically make your spouse a named insured when they live in your home or are on the title, but some only consider them an insured. That can be a problem if you ever need your spouse to file a claim, so be sure to check your policy. If your spouse isn’t named on the declaration page or if the definition of named insured doesn’t include spouse, ask your insurer to make a change.</p>\n<p>Not only are other insureds prohibited from filing claims or making coverage adjustments, they also aren’t necessarily covered by every aspect of your home insurance. Your children are a good example of this. They don’t own your home, so they don’t have an <a href=\"/glossary/insurable-interest/\">insurable interest</a> in it. However, they can have personal property that’s protected under Coverage C. Perhaps more importantly, their actions are typically included in your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability coverage</a>. Many policyholders have had to file <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claims</a> after their child breaks a neighbor's window playing baseball.</p>\n<p>People you employ in your home, such as housekeepers or nannies, may also be included in your personal property protection, but usually only that coverage. You can also cover your guests’ personal property, but you typically have to ask for that when you buy your policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"policyholdervsinsuredexample\">Policyholder vs. insured example</h3>\n<p>Let’s say Jenna decides to buy a house. She talks to a mortgage company and finds out she needs insurance before escrow will close, so she buys a homeowners policy. This makes Jenna the policyholder and named insured. In order to protect its investment, her mortgage lender asks to be an additional insured.</p>\n<p>Later, Jenna marries Joe, and he moves into her home. She contacts her insurance agent who tells her that as her spouse, Joe is automatically covered by her home insurance. However, she also asks to make Joe a named insured so he can file claims and make policy changes. Jenna then decides to <a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">increase her personal property coverage</a> because she wants to make sure they have enough insurance to protect the items Joe brought into the marriage.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatispmiinsurance\">What is PMI insurance?</h2>\n<p>Not to be confused with <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>, PMI is mortgage insurance required on most loans when buyers don't pay at least 20 percent of the home's purchase price as a down payment. Policies cover a percentage of the loan in the event that the borrower defaults, but they do not stop the foreclosure. They pay when the home doesn’t have enough value to be sold for the loan amount in a foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p>Most conventional mortgage lenders use the 20 percent threshold because they believe it’s enough of a cushion to regain the loan value in the event of a foreclosure. But that's not a hard-and-fast rule.</p>\n<p>More importantly, you can sometimes have your PMI insurance cancelled once you reach 20 percent equity in your home. Keep in mind that housing markets can cause this number to vary widely even during the early years of the loan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofprivatemortgageinsurance\">Types of private mortgage insurance</h2>\n<p>The five types of PMI insurance are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Borrower-paid mortgage insurance (BPMI).</strong> This is a monthly premium payment added to your mortgage payment and is the most common type of PMI insurance seen among borrowers. Lenders must cancel the payment once you have 22 percent equity as long as you are current on your mortgage payments, but you can usually ask your lender to cancel it when you have 20 percent equity.</li>\n<li><strong>Single-premium mortgage insurance (SPMI).</strong> This is a lump sum premium payment paid at closing or rolled into the entire loan value. You may have a lower monthly bill if you pick this option, but you should note that the upfront premium isn’t refundable. If you move or refinance, you could be out of the money you spent.</li>\n<li><strong>Lender-paid mortgage insurance (LPMI).</strong> In this type of PMI insurance, the lender pays the premium. However, the lender usually charges higher interest rates to cover the costs of the mortgage insurance. Moreover, you can’t cancel this type of PMI until you reach 78 percent equity in your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Split-premium mortgage insurance.</strong> This is a combination of the borrower-paid and single-premium mortgage insurance policies where the borrower pays a large sum up front (or has it rolled into the loan) plus a monthly payment. People may opt for this mortgage insurance when they have a high debt-to-income ratio that would make their monthly payments too expensive with a BPMI policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP).</strong> The term for PMI insurance on loans from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). MIP required for the life of an FHA loan where the borrower made a down payment of 10 percent or less.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whendoespmiinsuranceapplytohomeowners\">When does PMI insurance apply to homeowners?</h2>\n<p>Lenders impose PMI insurance when the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is more than 80 percent. The LTV compares the amount of your loan to the value of the home, so mortgage lenders use it to determine how much risk they’re taking on with a loan. The higher this ratio is (i.e., the more you have to borrow), the more risk for the lender. If you aren’t putting at least 20 percent down on the house, your lender will most likely require PMI insurance on your loan.</p>\n<p>Every <a href=\"/blog/fha-loan-requirements/\">FHA loan requires mortgage insurance</a> no matter how much your down payment is, and your payment will be slightly higher than most if you put less than five percent down. With an FHA loan, the PMI includes both an upfront payment (that can be rolled into the loan) and a monthly charge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoespmiinsurancecost\">How much does PMI insurance cost?</h2>\n<p>PMI insurance is not cheap. Payments are anywhere from 0.25 percent to 2 percent of the loan balance per year. This means for every $100,000 you borrow, you can expect to pay between $250 to $2,000 annually for mortgage insurance. That can tack on an extra $166 per month to your monthly mortgage payment.</p>\n<p>How much your PMI insurance costs will depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much your down payment is.</li>\n<li>How much you borrow.</li>\n<li>The terms of your loan term.</li>\n<li>Your credit score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PMI insurance can also affect your debt-to-income ratio, making it harder to qualify for your loan if the margins were narrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetprivatemortgageinsuranceremoved\">How to get private mortgage insurance removed</h2>\n<p>Sometimes your lender automatically removes the PMI insurance on your mortgage. This usually happens in one of two situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You reach the midway point of your mortgage, say 15 years in on a 30-year mortgage.</li>\n<li>Your mortgage balance reaches 78 percent of your home’s original loan value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of the 78 percent loan balance, you don’t have to wait for that extra bit of equity. While 78 percent is the threshold for automatically dropping PMI, you can request this from the lender as soon as you have the required 20 percent equity or an 80 percent LTV.</p>\n<p>But what happens if the house appreciates quickly and you get more than 20 percent of equity in it in just a few short years? This isn’t unheard of considering the way the housing market has been recently, but it doesn’t trigger the removal of the PMI.</p>\n<p>If your home appreciates quickly, get an appraisal for the new home value. A professional appraisal might cost you a few hundred dollars, but it may save you thousands per year. With the new appraisal, you can request that the lender remove the PMI based on the new value. If your lender has a clause in the loan contract that won’t allow you to merely remove the PMI, common in FHA loans, you may need to refinance the house based on the new LTV.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theprivatemortgageinsurancecancellationact\">The private mortgage insurance cancellation act</h2>\n<p>The PMI Cancellation Act, officially known as the Homeowners Protection Act, gives homeowners the right to remove and cancel PMI insurance as soon as they have built up enough equity in the property. While lender rules may vary on how you can cancel PMI, they have to give you an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>Savvy homebuyers ask about the PMI schedule when signing loan documents. They want to know when the soonest they can drop PMI is based on regular payments. Accelerating payments by paying down principal may allow you to drop PMI sooner than later.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisproofofinsurance\">What is proof of insurance?</h2>\n<p>All any document that demonstrates you have viable and active insurance for your home, auto, or other items can act as proof of insurance. The document homeowners most often to show they have insurance is the <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. This is a one-page summary that comes with your home insurance policy and typically states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The type of insurance.</li>\n<li>Your coverage limits.</li>\n<li>The address of the insured property.</li>\n<li>Any <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insureds</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your dec page isn’t the only document that can act as proof of insurance. Depending on who’s asking, you may also be able to use a letter from your insurance company or agent. If push comes to shove, you can even use your full policy as proof of insurance.</p>\n<p>Whatever document you use, just be sure it lists the <a href=\"/glossary/named-insured/\">named insured</a>, coverage limits, policy number, and the policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/effective-date/\">effective date</a> and expiration date. For a homeowners policy, your proof of insurance should also list the insured property’s address and your mortgage provider. Proof of insurance for other types of coverage may need other details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoineedproofofinsurance\">When do I need proof of insurance?</h2>\n<p>Situations when you need proof of insurance depend somewhat on the type of insurance you’re talking about. For example, you might need proof of auto insurance if you’re pulled over by a police officer. A landlord may also want to see proof of renters insurance before you sign a new lease.</p>\n<p>As a homeowner, you’ll most likely need proof of insurance when you get a mortgage or refinance your home. Your mortgage lender wants to see that the home is adequately covered to protect its financial interest in the property.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, that you get a mortgage and buy a home without getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> only to see the property totally destroyed in a fire. You’d still be responsible for paying off your mortgage, but you may be tempted to walk away. And without a home to repossess and sell, the mortgage company could end up taking a loss on the entire deal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wherecanifindmyproofofinsurance\">Where can I find my proof of insurance?</h2>\n<p>Getting proof of insurance is easy. In fact, insurance policies usually come with a declarations page so you have proof of insurance as soon as you buy coverage. If you’re a Kin policyholder, you can also download your declarations page and other documents through our <a href=\"https://app.kin.com/login\">online portal</a>. That way, you can share the file electronically or print a copy if that’s required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isproofofinsuranceenough\">Is proof of insurance enough?</h2>\n<p>Proof of insurance may not be enough to satisfy your mortgage lender’s requirements. Some lenders want to be named as an additional insured. As an additional insured, the lender receives notifications of major changes with the insurance policy such as a policy cancellation. If you cancel your policy, your lender may be notified and might obtain insurance on your behalf and bill you for it through your mortgage. This is called <a href=\"/glossary/force-placed-insurance/\">force placed insurance</a>, and it’s usually more expensive than home insurance you purchase on your own.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatispropertyandcasualtyinsurance\">What is property and casualty insurance?</h2>\n<p>Property and casualty insurance is a broad term that actually describes two types of coverage that protect you against financial losses. The property portion is insurance that protects your stuff, such as your car or home. The casualty portion covers your legal responsibility in situations where someone else suffers property damage or physical injuries.</p>\n<p>Each portion, called a “line” by insurance professionals, includes several different types of insurance policies. Insurance carriers, the companies that develop and underwrite policies, often specialize in property and casualty insurance. But some carriers create policies in other lines like health or life as well as in property and casualty insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatispropertyinsurance\">What is property insurance?</h2>\n<p>Property insurance covers your possessions. Some common types of property insurance include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">Condo insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>Car insurance.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">Landlord insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>Commercial property insurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The way property insurance coverage works is pretty simple. You buy a policy to cover something you own and pay a premium. In exchange for your premium, the insurance company promises to help you recover if something happens to the thing you insured by paying for the damage.</p>\n<p>For example, if your home’s damaged by a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> covered by your homeowners insurance then your insurance company pays for loss so you can repair damage. Most of the time, you have a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> (i.e., your portion of the claim) to pay, but the rest comes from your insurance company up to the coverage limits.</p>\n<p>Some property insurance policies also have a liability section that covers casualty claims, or claims dealing your responsibility for another party’s injuries or damages. Homeowners insurance is a good example of this. It includes several property coverage sections, such as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">other structures</a>, and even <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>. But it also has <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a>. This is why property and casualty insurance is often treated as one line of insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscasualtyinsurance\">What is casualty insurance?</h2>\n<p>Casualty insurance covers your responsibility if you harm someone else, either by causing them actual bodily injury or by damaging their possessions. That harm may result in a financial loss for the person you injured, and they have a right to seek compensation from you. If that happens, your casualty insurance helps you cover the cost.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s assume your dog bites a neighbor, and you end up being legally responsible for the neighbor’s medical bills. The casualty, or liability, portion of your homeowners insurance most likely covers the claim. Generally, there is no deductible on liability claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"makesureyoucoverageforhaveboth\">Make sure you coverage for have both</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how much property and casualty insurance you need to cover your home isn’t necessarily easy, but it is something you can tackle on your own. (We even have a <a href=\"/faq/how-much-homeowners-insurance-do-i-need/\">guide</a> to walk you through the basics!)</p>\n<p>Start by determining what it would cost to replace your home in a total loss. Anything less than its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>, and you risk coming up short during claim. Other property coverages are usually a percentage of your dwelling coverage. As for personal liability, we typically recommend homeowners have at least $100,000 in coverage, but that may go up depending on your situation. Last is your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments coverage</a>, which is usually around $1,000.</p>\n<p>Still have questions? <a href=\"/contact/\">Contact us</a> and one of our insurance representatives will be happy to help.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaprotectionclass\">What is a protection class?</h2>\n<p>The protection class ranking system was created by the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) as a fire risk assessment tool. Insurance carriers consider your home’s protection class when determining your <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">premium</a>.</p>\n<p>Your home's protection class depends on your community's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire department quality.</strong> The ISO looks at the department’s equipment, staff, training, and fire station distribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Water supply system.</strong> Key details here include the condition, maintenance, distribution, and inspection of fire hydrants. The ISO also compares the amount of available water to the amount needed to put out a fire.</li>\n<li><strong>Fire alarm and communications systems.</strong> The ISO gathers details about the area’s telephone systems, telephone lines, and the dispatch system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ISO evaluates this information and uses it to rank the area in one of 10 protection classes. The lower the protection class, the better the community’s fire protection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatdohomeownersneedtoknowaboutprotectionclass\">What do homeowners need to know about protection class?</h3>\n<p>You may never actually know your community’s protection class. The program was created for insurance industry professionals, not policyholders. But the number is still important because nearly all providers consider your protection class when calculating your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> premium.</p>\n<p>Let’s say your community has a protection class of 8. This means the fire department may have a harder time extinguishing a fire at your home because it's further away from a fire department or fire hydrant. As a result, your home may suffer more damage that your insurer has to cover. Your insurer has to protect its own assets, so it may charge you more to cover your home.</p>\n<p>Protection class 8 puts you on the bubble, but certain protection classes make getting coverage difficult:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Protection class 9,</strong> which means the community meets the ISO requirements for quality and communications but has an inadequate water supply.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection class 10,</strong> which means the community does not meet the ISO’s minimum standard in any category.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The industry considers these essentially “unprotected” classes, and some insurers won’t cover homes in these locations. Others may, but at a price.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatprotectionclassismyhomein\">What protection class is my home in?</h2>\n<p>The ISO only shares protection classes with insurance companies and agents. However, there are a few signs that indicate your home is in a high protection class. For instance, your home could be in protection class 9 or 10 if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is located in an unincorporated or rural area or is outside of city limits.</li>\n<li>Your fire department is staffed by volunteers.</li>\n<li>The primary fire department is five miles away or farther.</li>\n<li>The nearest fire hydrant is more than 1,000 feet away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your home is in protection class 9 or 10, you may end up paying more for your insurance. Comparing policies from multiple insurance providers can help you find a more competitive rate for your coverage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"caniimprovemyprotectionclass\">Can I improve my protection class?</h3>\n<p>Improving your protection class is difficult. It takes a significant amount of community resources to upgrade your fire department’s equipment, staff, and training. You may be better off looking for other ways to reduce your fire risk. For instance, you might try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing unnecessary structures.</li>\n<li>Trimming trees and brush near your home.</li>\n<li>Installing a smoke detector or fire alarm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reducing your fire risk minimizes the chance of a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a>, and insurance companies may offer premium discounts for it.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisrealproperty\">What is real property?</h2>\n<p>If you own real property, you own a piece of land. But you also own whatever is permanently fixed to that land. That might be a building, like your home, or other structures, such a fence or swimming pool. Even vegetation like the trees in your yard can be part of real property.</p>\n<p>For the items on your land to be considered part of your real property, they must be immovable or permanently fixed to the land. For example, a temporary shed isn’t real property, but one built on a foundation typically is.</p>\n<p>When you look at it that way, other examples of real property can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permanent outbuildings.</li>\n<li>Landscaping.</li>\n<li>Water features, including canals and pounds.</li>\n<li>Other resources in the land, such as minerals and oil.</li>\n<li>Roads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, real property includes a bundle of rights that describe what the owner can do to with their property. The bundle of rights varies by location, but it generally grants the property owner the following rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The right to possess.</li>\n<li>The right to control.</li>\n<li>The right to enjoyment.</li>\n<li>The right to disposal.</li>\n<li>The right to exclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, the bundle of rights allows you to occupy your real property and decide how to use it and who else gets to come on it. It also includes the right to sell, will, or transfer ownership of your real property to whomever you choose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personalpropertyvsrealproperty\">Personal property vs. real property</h2>\n<p>Personal property describes items you can own that aren’t permanently attached to the land, like clothing, furniture, and appliances. In general, you can move personal property from one place to another. Real property, on the other hand, is typically immobile. Only under the rarest circumstances would someone move a house or tree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"realpropertyandhomeinsurance\">Real property and home insurance</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> covers many aspects of your real property. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a> insures the structure of your home as well as your trees, plants, and other aspects of your landscaping (Note: the coverage available for landscaping is limited). Other structures on your property are insured through <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>.</p>\n<p>Land, however, is usually not covered by home insurance. Think of it this way: if your house burned to the ground in a fire, you’d still own the land. That portion of your real property wouldn’t be lost, so it’s not usually included on your homeowners policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"realpropertyhomeinsuranceclaimexample\">Real property home insurance claim example</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you bought a house on an acre of land that also has a detached garage. This plus the bundle of rights you enjoy as the owner constitutes your real property. The contents of the home, like electronics, furniture, and many of the appliances, count as personal property. To protect this investment, you buy a homeowners policy that covers the dwelling, its contents, and other structures, as well as <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a>, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use</a>, and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments</a> coverages.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a tornado blows through and destroys your home.

    body: "<h2 id=\"reinsurancedefinition\">Reinsurance definition</h2>\n<p>Think of reinsurance as insurance for insurance companies. Just like you get a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners policy</a> in case something devastating happens to your home, an insurance company buys reinsurance to protect against exceedingly large losses. </p>\n<p>An insurance company buys reinsurance that covers some or all of its risk to help ensure it can pay policyholders after a catastrophic event. If a large number of the company’ policyholders experience catastrophic events, then it may be able to recoup some of the money it pays out in claims.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howreinsuranceworks\">How reinsurance works</h2>\n<p>At a minimum, reinsurance involves two parties who enter a contract. The first party is the one that buys the reinsurance coverage. It’s sometimes called the ceding party because it “gives up” some of its liability to the second party, the reinsurer. In exchange for taking on the ceding party’s liability, the reinsurer gets paid according to the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p>This is what insurance people mean when they talk about transferring risk, and it’s essentially the same as what happens when you buy a policy. You pay a premium so that some of your risk transfers to your insurance company. Few people can take on all of the risk of owning a home, but home insurance makes it possible.</p>\n<p>That’s basically the idea behind reinsurance, too. By getting reinsurance, the ceding company, which is usually an insurer that sells policies to consumers, limits its exposure to catastrophic loss.</p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, you own an insurance company that specializes in <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida home insurance</a>. Your policyholders rightly expect that you can pay their claims if a covered event occurs. But with so many homes in a high-risk area, you have to think about what might happen if a major hurricane blows through and causes damage to most (or all!) of your policyholders’ homes.</p>\n<p>To guard against that possibility, you buy reinsurance. Now if a hurricane or some other covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> does cause catastrophic damage, your company is prepared to meet its obligations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofreinsurance\">Types of reinsurance</h2>\n<p>Most insurance companies use reinsurance, but what that looks like can vary quite a bit. First, there are two general methods for reinsurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facultative coverage, which means reinsurance is negotiated for each policy separately.</li>\n<li>Treaty reinsurance, where the reinsurer covers a portion of all the insurance company’s policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, there are an additional five types of reinsurance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proportional.</strong> In this type of reinsurance, which falls under the treaty reinsurance method, the ceding company sells a prorated portion of each policy to one or more reinsurers. The reinsurer gets a portion of each premium in exchange for paying a portion of each claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-proportional.</strong> Another type of treaty reinsurance, non-proportional reinsurance only kicks in if the ceding company’s claims exceed a certain amount in a given period.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk-attaching coverage.</strong> Any claims stemming from the ceding company’s policies are covered no matter when the loss occurs as long as the policies were created during the reinsurance contract. Claims aren’t covered for policies that began outside of the reinsurance contract, even if the loss occurred while reinsurance was in force.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss-occurring coverage.</strong> In loss-occurring reinsurance, it doesn’t matter when the policies were created. The reinsurer covers all claims that occur during the life of the reinsurance contract. Losses that happen after the reinsurance contract expires are not covered.</li>\n<li><strong>Claims-made coverage.</strong> Claims are covered as long as they’re reported to the insurance company during the reinsurance contact. This is different from loss-occurring coverage because here the date of claim report is considered the date of the actual loss. Loss-occurring coverage only kicks in if the date of the loss happens during the reinsurance contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whyreinsuranceisimportant\">Why reinsurance is important</h2>\n<p>When an insurance company has a large number of policies in a particular area, it becomes more susceptible to catastrophic claims. Reinsurance provides insurance companies in that situation with the finances to pay claims they may not be able to financially handle. In some extreme cases, reinsurance can even help an insurance company stay solvent.</p>\n<p>But there’s a benefit to reinsurance for homeowners, too, particularly if they live in an area where extreme weather is common. Basically, reinsurance provides a cushion that allows insurance companies to take on more risk. One of the reasons we can insure homes in Florida is because we have a <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">strong reinsurance program</a> that helps us offer coverage that people can afford.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisreplacementcostcoverage\">What is replacement cost coverage?</h2>\n<p>Replacement cost is the amount it would cost to replace or rebuild an item of similar quality using materials and goods that are currently available.</p>\n<p>Replacement cost coverage insures your property for what it would cost to repair or replace your damaged property without subtracting its <a href=\"/glossary/depreciation/\">depreciation</a>. This number may be <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">different than your home's market value</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesreplacementcostcoveragework\">How does replacement cost coverage work?</h3>\n<p>The decisions you make when your first buy <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> impact how much your provider pays on a claim. Replacement cost coverage is a good example of this.</p>\n<p>Insuring your property for its replacement cost value means your insurer pays to replace it with property that's similar in quality. Your other option is to insure your property for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value (ACV)</a>. Insuring your home for its ACV means your provider deducts depreciation from your claims payout.</p>\n<p>Many home insurance companies automatically offer replacement cost coverage for the structure of your home. Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property</a>, like appliances, fixtures, and furniture, is usually insured for its actual cash value. That doesn’t mean you can’t opt for replacement cost coverage; you may just have to ask for it.</p>\n<p>Even when you get replacement cost coverage, you may be surprised by your payout after a claim. That’s because most insurance companies first pay your property’s actual cash value, and then reimburse you once you’ve replaced or repaired the item.</p>\n<h3 id=\"replacementcostexample\">Replacement cost example</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you bought a new flat-screen television for $2,000 three years ago. Unfortunately, it’s stolen, so you file a claim on your home insurance. With an actual cash value policy, your insurer subtracts a certain percentage for three years of depreciation. Now here’s what happens if you have replacement cost coverage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your insurance provider sends an initial payment for the TV’s depreciated value.</li>\n<li>You purchase a new television similar to the stolen one and submit the receipt to your insurer.</li>\n<li>Your insurance provider pays you the difference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The price of your replacement property may be more the original item’s price tag, but your home insurer usually still pays. Just be sure to check your policy terms. Replacement cost coverage payouts cannot exceed your policy property limits.</p>\n<p>Insurers also have a minimum requirement for replacement cost coverage. This is called the 80/20 rule. Essentially, your insurance policy must cover 80% of your home’s replacement value. Come up short, and your insurance provider may only pay a portion of the replacement costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howismyhomesreplacementcostcalculated\">How is my home’s replacement cost calculated?</h2>\n<p>At Kin, we calculate your home’s replacement cost for you. Our formula takes into consideration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your total square footage (not including the land your home sits on).</li>\n<li>Your local construction costs.</li>\n<li>Your home's frame and exterior.</li>\n<li>Your home's style (Cape Cod, Victorian, etc.).</li>\n<li>Total number of rooms and bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Roof type and materials.</li>\n<li>Your home's unique features and architecture.</li>\n<li>Other structures on your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But to give yourself a rough estimate of your home's replacement cost, you can multiply the square footage of your home by your local construction costs per square foot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doineedreplacementcostcoverage\">Do I need replacement cost coverage?</h2>\n<p>You might want to invest in the replacement cost coverage if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can't make repairs on your own.</strong> A person with carpentry or construction experience may be able to forgo replacement cost coverage. But if you're all thumbs when it comes to repairs, then broader coverage might make sense.</li>\n<li><strong>You have valuable personal property.</strong> Expensive and hard-to-replace items may justify the additional expense. Take a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a> to see just how much you may be on the hook for after a disaster.</li>\n<li><strong>You invested in new property.</strong> You may want the extra protection for additions, renovations, and upgrades.</li>\n<li><strong>The peace of mind is worth it.</strong> Replacement cost coverage does cost a little more than ACV insurance, but it offers significantly higher payouts when you need to make a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting an actual cash value policy may save you money on premiums, but it can leave you underinsured when it’s time to file a claim. Do your research and talk to an agent to make sure you’re adequately insured.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtogetreplacementcostcoverage\">How to get replacement cost coverage</h3>\n<p>First, you can buy your home insurance through Kin.

But scheduling property often means your insurer covers additional events, including accidental loss of the item.</li>\n<li><strong>Replacement cost coverage.</strong> Scheduled property is usually written on a <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement-cost</a> basis.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatissinkholeinsurance\">What is sinkhole insurance?</h2>\n<p>Sinkhole insurance is a home insurance <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> (i.e., an addition to your policy) that can help pay for structural damage sinkholes cause. This coverage applies to your home and your personal property.</p>\n<p>Simply put (because this can get complicated fast), a sinkhole is a depression in the surface of the ground caused by the sudden collapse of the land’s surface layer. When a sinkhole occurs near a home, its effects can be devastating.</p>\n<p>That’s why sinkhole insurance is so important in regions that experience sinkhole activity, like Florida. If the ground collapses and cracks your home’s foundation, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair the damage. And that’s if your home isn’t completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>Sinkhole insurance offers a way forward after the unexpected strikes. It can help pay for necessary, expensive repairs, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stabilizing the land and the home</li>\n<li>Repairing the foundation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howsinkholecoverageworks\">How sinkhole coverage works</h3>\n<p>If you have sinkhole coverage, it applies when your home sustains structural damage. Usually, that means your property shows signs of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Floor displacement</li>\n<li>Foundation displacement</li>\n<li>Buckling walls</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A professional engineer who can identify sinkhole activity according to state testing standards must confirm the loss was caused by a sinkhole.</p>\n<p>When you draw on this coverage, a sinkhole deductible applies. Usually, it’s 10 percent of your dwelling insurance limit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsinkholeinsurancedoesntcover\">What sinkhole insurance doesn’t cover</h3>\n<p>Depending on your insurance, some exclusions apply. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some insurers don’t cover damages resulting from mine subsidence.</li>\n<li>Many insurers won’t cover properties with existing sinkhole damage, such as minor cracks in the foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before issuing a sinkhole insurance policy, some insurance companies require a professional engineer to visually inspect the home. The homeowner is often required to pay the inspection fee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issinkholeinsurancerequired\">Is sinkhole insurance required?</h2>\n<p>You, the policyholder, are not legally obligated to add sinkhole insurance to your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>. But certain states require <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">home insurers</a> to offer catastrophic ground collapse coverage as part of their homeowners insurance, while others require earth movement to be made available as an optional extra.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t buy sinkhole coverage with Kin, we still provide catastrophic ground collapse coverage as part of your standard homeowners insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sinkholeinsurancevscatastrophicgroundcoveragecollapse\">Sinkhole insurance vs. catastrophic ground coverage collapse</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/catastrophic-ground-cover-collapse/\">Catastrophic ground cover collapse</a> applies to some geological activity, but its coverage is less robust than sinkhole insurance. In order for catastrophic ground coverage collapse insurance to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's an abrupt collapse of ground cover</li>\n<li>The depression in the ground cover is clearly visible</li>\n<li>The home and its foundation sustained structural damage</li>\n<li>A government entity condemned the structure and ordered it to be vacated</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contrast, sinkhole coverage does <strong>not</strong> require the government to condemn the structure (a very high threshold to meet) in order to cover a sinkhole loss.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it can be difficult to find coverage if your home has unrepaired or remediated sinkhole damage. Kin currently does not offer coverage for these homes.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about your home’s sinkhole protection, talk to a Kin representative today.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howdoesaninsurancedeductiblework\">How does an insurance deductible work?</h2>\n<p>An insurance deductible is the amount that you pay out of pocket before your homeowners insurance takes effect and covers an insurable loss. In the event of a covered claim, your deductible is deducted from your claims payment, and your insurer pays the balance up to the maximum limit stated in your policy.</p>\n<p>For example, if you make a covered theft claim for $1,200 and your standard deductible is $500, your insurance company usually deducts your share of the claim – $500 – and pays the claim balance of $700.</p>\n<p>As the homeowner and <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a>, you typically get to choose the amount of your deductible when you select your insurance policy. This gives you a certain amount of control over your insurance <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-premium-definition/\">premium</a>. Selecting a higher deductible usually results in a lower premium. You should note, however, that most <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> offer specific amounts to choose from and often require a minimum deductible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyareinsurancedeductiblesnecessary\">Why are insurance deductibles necessary?</h3>\n<p>One of the most important reasons that insurance companies require deductibles is that it reduces a risk to the company called a <a href=\"/glossary/moral-hazard-insurance/\">moral hazard</a>. Because your home insurance protects you from major losses – and that’s a good thing! – but that may take away your incentive to avoid risky behavior. Insurance deductibles mean you carry some of the financial responsibility in a claim, and insurance companies hope that encourages you to reduce your chance of loss.</p>\n<p>Deductibles also help insurance companies minimize the impact insurance claims have on their rates and <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">financial stability</a>. Making insurers responsible for the entirety of every loss could create an overwhelming number of claims that would drive up insurance rates while also straining the company’s resources to meet its responsibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofinsurancedeductibles\">Types of insurance deductibles</h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> can have more than one deductible. For example, here are some common deductibles you’ll choose when buying a policy from Kin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AOP deductible:</strong> Sometimes called a standard deductible, an all other perils (AOP) deductible applies to many of the losses covered by your home insurance policy, such as fire and theft.</li>\n<li><strong>Hurricane deductible:</strong> A <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> applies to damage caused by the high winds and heavy rains of a named storm.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind / hail deductible:</strong> If heavy winds, rains, or hail damage your home, then you may pay a <a href=\"/glossary/wind-hail-deductible/\">wind / hail deductible</a>. This is sometimes called a severe convective storm deductible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whendoesanaopdeductibleapply\">When does an AOP deductible apply?</h3>\n<p>The standard deductible applies to most property claims each time you file. Some common examples include claims for theft, windstorms or fire.</p>\n<p>They generally don’t apply when you file a liability claim. And as we noted above, some events have their own deductibles. Damage caused by those events does not trigger your standard deductible.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you experience some damage during a storm that gets named by the National Weather Service. That’s often one indication that your hurricane deductible applies and not your AOP deductible. Other factors can also apply.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howmuchisastandardhomeinsurancedeductible\">How much is a standard home insurance deductible?</h3>\n<p>A deductible is expressed either as a fixed amount or a percentage of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a>. Your deductible options may vary from insurer to insurer. To see your deductible, just flip to the <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a> of your home insurance policy.</p>\n<p>Read your policy and ask your agent if you have any questions about how your deductible works. That way, you know what to expect when it’s time to file a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdeductibleshelpyoucontrolpremiumpayments\">How deductibles help you control premium payments</h2>\n<p>The larger your deductible, the lower your premiums tend to be. That’s because you take on greater responsibility for the cost of a claim – and your settlement payout will be less, too.</p>\n<p>Though it might be tempting to take on the largest deductible available to lower your premium payments, it’s important to choose one you can comfortably afford at the time of a claim.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"themeaningofsubrogationininsurance\">The meaning of subrogation in insurance</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to understand subrogation in insurance is to think of it as an insurance company stepping into its policyholder’s shoes. This usually occurs during an <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">insurance claim</a> where you, the policyholder, aren’t at fault. Because your insurance company has the right to stand in your place, it can seek compensation from the party who’s actually responsible for your loss or from that party’s <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a>.</p>\n<p>Subrogation clauses are important components in <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-policy/\">insurance policies</a> because they help insurance companies to deal with claims quickly. As a policyholder, subrogation can mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A faster claim payout.</strong> You don’t have to wait for your insurance company and the other party’s insurance company to determine who is at fault.</li>\n<li><strong>Reimbursement for your deductible.</strong> Any money your insurer recovers are first used to refund the deductible if one was applied to your loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howsubrogationininsuranceworks\">How subrogation in insurance works</h2>\n<p>As a policyholder, you don’t have much to do when it comes to subrogation. Most of the action happens behind the scenes, particularly if you’re the one who experienced a loss caused by another insured party. Your insurance company typically pays your claim ﹘ assuming the situation merits coverage ﹘ and then works with the other party’s insurer to who is responsible for the damage and how much they owe.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say a limb falls from your neighbor’s dead tree and damages your roof, so you file a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. Your insurance company determines this is a compensable event and pays for your damage. However, your insurer also investigates the event only to discover that your neighbor had neglected that tree for years and ignored repeated requests to cut it down. Subrogation gives your insurer a chance to reclaim the money it’s paid you.</p>\n<p>While these issues are typically handled seamlessly between insurance carriers, your insurance carrier may need to sue the other party if they deny fault. Without subrogation, your insurer wouldn’t be able to file that lawsuit. You should know, however, that whether or not there’s lawsuit you, the <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insured</a>, are required to assist with your insurance company during the subrogation process. This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An assignment of rights of recovery for a loss to the extent that payment is made by the insurer.</li>\n<li>Signing and delivering all related papers regarding the subrogation.</li>\n<li>Cooperating with your insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatisawaiverofsubrogation\">What is a waiver of subrogation?</h2>\n<p>A waiver of subrogation is an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> you can add to your policy that waives your insurance company’s right to stand in for you. It essentially stops subrogation from happening.</p>\n<p>You may see waivers of subrogation in business insurance policies, but they are rare in home insurance. If you do run across one, you’ll likely be asked to pay an additional fee to add it to your coverage. This is because it limits the insurance company’s ability to be compensated for claims it shouldn’t have to pay.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"insuranceunderwritingdefinition\">Insurance underwriting definition</h2>\n<p>Before an insurance company can offer you a policy, it has to decide if it can afford to take on the risk. The process it uses to figure this out is called underwriting. Essentially, the insurance company uses the information you provide on its application plus a few public documents to evaluate your chances of filing a <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claim</a>. If your risk fits the company’s underwriting guidelines, it typically sets a premium and offers you a policy.</p>\n<p>Our underwriting process is different from many of our competitors in that we go beyond the information you provide when you apply. In fact, we look at <a href=\"/blog/insurance-data/\">thousands of data points</a> to fine tune our underwriting. As a result, we can often provide more affordable <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> to more homeowners ﹘ even when their homes are in high-risk areas like coastal Florida.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtheinsuranceunderwritingprocessworks\">How the insurance underwriting process works</h2>\n<p>Most <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> have underwriting departments staffed with professionals who are trained in risk assessment. These underwriters are the people who decide if the insurance company will offer you a policy and how much that policy will cost.</p>\n<p>When it comes to homeowners policies, the insurance underwriting process includes several steps, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Evaluating your information.</strong> Insurance applications often ask for basic information required by underwriters. This may include personal details, like your Social Security number, as well as certain construction details about your home.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewing the house’s loss history.</strong> The insurance company’s underwriter will most likely run a loss history. This is a report that details any insurance losses associated with your home, and it can help the underwriter identify potential issues that may make your home more costly to insure.</li>\n<li><strong>Checking your credit history.</strong> An underwriter may check your credit to see if you’re capable of paying the premium. However, not every state allows insurance companies to consider credit reports during underwriting.</li>\n<li><strong>Assessing your home’s condition.</strong> Your insurance company may also send a field underwriter to examine the exterior of your house to determine if the house is in good shape or in disrepair. Some companies can do this with satellite imagery.</li>\n<li><strong>Solving problems.</strong> Part of the underwriting process includes working with you or your agent to get you insured. This may mean adding <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsements</a> to your policy or asking you to make improvements to reduce your chances of a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the underwriter has all the information, they assess the risk and assign a rate to it. This is how your final premium is calculated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyismypremiumdifferentfrommyquote\">Why is my premium different from my quote?</h2>\n<p>An insurance quote is really just an estimate of your final premium, but it comes before the underwriting process is complete. This means that you can get a quote for an amount that is different from the actual cost of the policy.</p>\n<p>For instance, let’s say you’re sure your home was built in 1965 and that you got a new roof just a few years ago. You put that on your application and get a quote of $1,100 per year for homeowners insurance. That sounds pretty good to you, so you decide to buy the policy and pay the premium. This triggers the underwriting process.</p>\n<p>While searching public records, the underwriter discovers that your home was actually built in 1955 and that the roof is closer to 15 years old. These are not issues that cause the insurance company to reject your application, but they may cause the premium to go up.</p>\n<p>In your case, the insurance company sends a policy with an updated premium for $1,200 per year. You can either pay the additional $100 of premium, or you can cancel the policy and get a refund for any unused premium.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"theftdefinitionininsurance\">Theft: Definition in insurance</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies generally define theft the same as everyone else (i.e., someone takes property that doesn’t belong to them). Several types of policies, including <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policies</a>, cover losses from theft and attempted theft. In insurance-speak, that means theft is a covered <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> on those policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theftinsuranceinyourhomeownerspolicy\">Theft insurance in your homeowners policy</h2>\n<p>Theft insurance is simply coverage for when someone steals your property. However, most people don’t need a separate theft insurance policy because the coverage appears in their home insurance in a variety of ways, namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal property coverage.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a> is probably what comes to mind when you think about a loss from theft because it helps replace stolen items.</li>\n<li><strong>Dwelling coverage.</strong> A thief can also cause physical damage to your home. <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a> helps pay for repairs, such as broken door frames.</li>\n<li><strong>Other structures coverage.</strong> If a detached structure like a garage or shed is damaged by an intruder, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a> can help with those repairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having your property stolen can be a traumatic experience. But the theft insurance in your homeowners policy can be a big help in getting things back to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenistheftcovered\">When is theft covered?</h2>\n<p>If someone breaks into your home, your homeowners policy typically covers your stolen items as well as any damage the thief caused. One cool feature in homeowners insurance is that most policies even cover these losses when they occur away from your home. This means that if someone steals from your hotel room while you are on vacation, your insurance company most likely covers that loss up to your policy limits.</p>\n<p>However, home insurance policies don’t necessarily cover the entirety of your losses. How much you recover in a claim is usually impacted by your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coverage limits.</strong> Each of the coverages that apply after a theft has a coverage limit (i.e., the maximum amount your insurance company pays for a claim). If a thief takes $50,000 worth of property, but you only have $40,000 in personal property coverage, then you’re going to come up short.</li>\n<li><strong>Deductibles.</strong> Let’s assume the thief also smashes in your front door. Your policy covers that damage, but it also has a $500 <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>. You’re responsible for covering that amount for any repairs.</li>\n<li><strong>Sublimits.</strong> Most insurance companies also place sublimits on valuable personal property. A sublimit caps the amount you recover, sometimes limiting your coverage to just $1,500.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sublimits are common for items like computers, jewelry, fine art, and collectibles. You can protect these items with a <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property endorsement</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenistheftnotcovered\">When is theft not covered?</h2>\n<p>Not all theft scenarios are covered. For example, home insurance policies typically exclude theft if the items were stolen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By you.</li>\n<li>From a home that’s under construction.</li>\n<li>From a home that you rent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the first <a href=\"/glossary/exclusion/\">exclusion</a>, insurance companies simply don’t cover an insured’s illegal actions. But the other two are about increased risk. For example, more people come in and out of a home when it’s under construction, so there’s a greater chance for something to be stolen.</p>\n<p>The same is true when you rent the home out. Even if you believe you know your tenants very well, their presence (and their guests, for that matter) increases your risk for theft. You could protect yourself with <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord insurance</a>, but another option is our versatile <a href=\"/home-insurance/house-and-property-insurance/\">House & Property policy</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also note that homeowners insurance seldom covers stolen cash ﹘mainly because it’s difficult to prove the loss.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"vandalismdefinition\">Vandalism definition</h2>\n<p>When someone deliberately damages your property, that person has committed an act of vandalism. That’s true whether the vandal has deface your home, another structure on your property, or one of your personal belongings.</p>\n<p>Every state has its own vandalism definition, but the definition generally requires three parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical damage.</strong> The physical property damage vandalism causes doesn’t have to be huge or even permanent.</li>\n<li><strong>Someone else’s property</strong>. While the damaged property can be private or public, it has to be owned by someone other than the person doing the damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Intentionality.</strong> Vandalism can only happen on purpose. Even if someone causes physical damage to your home, they are only vandals if they intended to destroy or deface it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vandalism can be frustrating for homeowners. Imagine going on vacation and coming back to find graffiti on your garage door. That might seem like a small nuisance, but vandalism can feel both senseless and personal when it happens to you. Plus, you need to get it removed quickly, and in some places, that can cost anywhere from $1 to $3.50 per square foot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"examplesofvandalism\">Examples of vandalism</h3>\n<p>Vandalism comes in many forms. In addition to graffiti, some common examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smashing mailboxes.</li>\n<li>Cutting down shrubs.</li>\n<li>Breaking windows.</li>\n<li>Egging or toilet papering the property. While this may seem harmless in many ways, it does require a lot of clean-up and can require hiring someone to take care of it.</li>\n<li>Carving initials into wood fences or trees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"isvandalismcoveredbyinsurance\">Is vandalism covered by insurance?</h2>\n<p>Vandalism is a <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">peril</a> that most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policies</a> cover. In fact, even named peril coverage forms, like an <a href=\"/glossary/ho2-policy/\">HO2 policy</a>, usually mention vandalism as a covered event. This means home insurance covers most acts of vandalism. The amount of coverage does depend on your insurance company’s <a href=\"/glossary/limit-of-liability/\">limit of liability</a> and your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you do come home to graffiti on your garage door, so you hire someone to remove it and file a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim</a> with your <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurer</a>. The bill from the removal company is $1,000, but your deductible is $500. That’s the amount you're responsible for, and your insurance company pays the remaining $500.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whenisvandalismnotcoveredbyinsurance\">When is vandalism not covered by insurance?</h3>\n<p>While vandalism is a covered peril, it isn’t always covered by home insurance. Many homeowners policies don’t cover vandalism if your home is vacant for a certain length of time, typically around 30 to 60 days; others may cover it, but usually only when you’ve notified your insurance provider that you’re leaving it vacant.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies also only pay claims on property you're responsible for. For homeowners, that means your home and possessions. (This doesn’t include your car ﹘ your auto insurance policy will most likely respond to that.) Similarly, <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> only pays vandalism claims if the condo owner’s unit and property are involved. Damage to shared areas (e.g., elevators and hallways) is typically handled by the condominium’s master policy.</p>\n<p>One more note: your home insurance policy most likely extends coverage to direct family members living at your residence. These people are <a href=\"/glossary/insured/\">insureds</a>, and the damage they cause is not considered vandalism, even when it’s intentional.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattodoifyourhomeisvandalized\">What to do if your home is vandalized</h2>\n<p>Finding your home vandalized is upsetting, but it’s important to take action immediately. The following steps can help when it’s time to file a claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Call the police</strong>. Even if the damage appears minor, you want to call the police and file a report. The damage may be more costly than you assume, and a police police report can be a big help in an insurance claim.</li>\n<li><strong>Record your damage.</strong> Pictures and videos can be used as evidence in your claim and if the police actually catch the vandals.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your home.</strong> Once you have evidence of the event, you want to minimize your exposure to more damage. This may mean boarding up windows or sweeping away glass. However, hold off on repairs until your <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">insurance adjuster</a> arrives.</li>\n<li><strong>Call your insurance company.</strong> Again, you want to do this even if the damage appears insignificant. Most home insurance policies require you to report incidents even if you don’t plan on filing a claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you contact your insurer, make sure you have your policy number, police report, and any other evidence on hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodetervandalism\">How to deter vandalism</h2>\n<p>While vandals can attack any home, you can reduce your chances of getting vandalized with some simple actions. For example, you don’t leave your home vacant for extended periods. If you go on vacation, make sure to have someone stop by and check on your house. You can also have your mail and newspaper delivery stopped temporarily or ask a trusted neighbor to pick them up. Vandals are less likely to target homes with people in them or regular activity happening on the property.</p>\n<p>Another good option is to Install security cameras and make sure to light the exterior of your home. Motion sensor lights can be a great deterrent to vandals who don’t want to be seen or caught on camera doing the mischief. Not only will this help deter vandals, but it can also help reduce your home insurance costs with <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">discounts</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatiswallsininsurance\">What is walls-in insurance?</h2>\n<p>Walls-in insurance, also called single entity coverage or studs in coverage, covers a condo building from the exterior framing to the walls in the home. That’s where the term “walls-in” comes from. These policies tend to cover fixtures in the individual condo unit, but not alterations, appliances, or personal belongings. That’s a job for the unit owner’s <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo (HO6) insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>This is a type of property insurance policy your condo or homeowners association buys to fulfill their insurance obligations for the building. There are three ways the HOA can cover a building.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understandingthe3typesofhoainsurance\">Understanding the 3 types of HOA insurance</h3>\n<p>The insurance policy your HOA buys is often called <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">HOA insurance</a> or the master insurance policy. Walls-in insurance is one of three types of master insurance. Understanding what each type of policy covers can help you buy the appropriate condo insurance and better navigate the claims process.</p>\n<p>Each type of coverage protects the building slightly differently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bare walls-in</strong>: This provides limited coverage for the exterior structure and all the common areas of the building. It’s the least comprehensive policy of the three.</li>\n<li><strong>Walls-in</strong>: This also covers the building common areas, and its coverage for the structure extends from the exterior framing to the walls of the individual units. It can cover top flooring, cabinets, and countertops as long as they have not been altered, and it’s the type of policy most HOAs buy.</li>\n<li><strong>All In</strong>: This is the most comprehensive policy. It provides coverage from the exterior walls in to include appliances, improvements and alterations, ventilation, and security equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wherewallsininsuranceendsandyourcondoinsurancebegins\">Where walls-in insurance ends and your condo insurance begins</h2>\n<p>While the HOA’s walls-in insurance offers a little more coverage for your individual unit, it does not appropriately protection your home from disaster. To fill the coverage gaps, you need your own condo insurance policy (also called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 policy</a>). Walls-in insurance will not cover renovations you’ve made to your condo, your appliances, personal property, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability</a>. But condo insurance will.</p>\n<p>There may be some slight overlap in coverage between your policy and the HOA insurance, particularly if your HOA has a walls-in or an all in policy.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say an electrical short starts a kitchen fire that damages your condo’s appliances, floor, cabinets, and countertop. If the HOA has a walls-in policy, it may cover the damage to the walls, floor, cabinets, and countertop. Your policy may offer coverage for that, plus coverage for the appliances and lost personal property, such as furniture, dishware, and other home goods.</p>\n<p>In a case like this, it may make sense to notify both your HOA and your insurance company about the loss and let the insurance carriers determine which policy is responsible for what part of the claim.</p>\n<p>Follow the same protocol you would to file a claim with your own insurer by mitigating the loss (i.e. shutting water off if a pipe burst), documenting the damage, and calling claims as soon as possible to get an adjuster out to the scene. If you don’t need to file a claim on your own HO6 policy, don’t. Even small claims can have a long-term effect on your premium and insurance costs. It could even lead to cancelation. This is why it is important to work through the master policy for as much as you can when it is appropriate to do so.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtoknowifyourhoahaswallsininsuranceforyourbuilding\">How to know if your HOA has walls-in insurance for your building</h3>\n<p>When you become a condo owner, you should receive a copy of the HOA bylaws, budget, and insurance policy. As a condo owner, you have a right to call and ask about the coverage the master policy provides.</p>\n<p>You’ll often need a current copy of your HOA’s bylaws when you shop for your own condo insurance.

While water backup coverage is an essential safety net when the unexpected happens, do what you can to prevent backups and overflows. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't pour grease down the drain.</strong> Pouring grease down the drain is convenient, but it can do a number on your pipes. The grease can harden and create a clog that causes water backup. Plus, cooking oils aren’t great for the environment. Instead, collect grease in a can and throw it away in the trash.</li>\n<li><strong>Dispose paper products appropriately.</strong> Only toilet paper should go down the toilet. Nearly everything else – sanitary products, paper towels, and diapers – can cause clogs.</li>\n<li><strong>Check for roots.</strong> Tree roots are one of the biggest threats to your plumbing system. Some signs that a problem is imminent are slow emptying drains and sinkholes in your lawn. If you see either of these, you may want to hire a plumber to run a sewer line camera through your pipes.</li>\n<li><strong>Perform regular maintenance.</strong> Regularly clean out your gutters and have your pipes flushed every year. If you have a sump pump, unplug it to look for corrosion and remove debris on an annual basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a backwater prevention valve</strong>.This simple valve allows water and waste out but won’t let it back in. However, installing one is a job for a professional plumber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a little care, you can reduce your chances of having water backup problems.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisadwelling\">What is a dwelling?</h2>\n<p>Most people know that “dwelling” is another word for “residence.” Your dwelling is the place where you live, whether that’s a house, condo, or apartment. This is pretty much the dwelling definition for insurance too, except that insurance companies add structures that are attached to your residence. These might include an attached garage or carport.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dwellingorcontents\">Dwelling or contents?</h2>\n<p>The stuff inside your home is generally not considered part of your dwelling. That sounds kind of obvious, but you’d be surprised how often people confuse the two. It’s one reason insurance agents tell their clients to imagine picking up a home and tipping it over. Anything that falls out counts as contents. Whatever remains is dwelling.</p>\n<p>If you look at it that way, dwelling means your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frame.</li>\n<li>Walls.</li>\n<li>Floors.</li>\n<li>Installed cabinets and counters.</li>\n<li>Stairs.</li>\n<li>Permanently attached appliances connected to public utilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> insures these things through <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>.</p>\n<p>The list of things that are considered contents is much longer, but it generally includes items like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furniture.</li>\n<li>Electronics.</li>\n<li>Clothes.</li>\n<li>Appliances that aren’t permanently attached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The contents of your home (i.e., the items that would fall out if you could tip your dwelling upside down) are protected under <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a>, or personal property coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dwellingdefinitionforcondos\">Dwelling definition for condos</h2>\n<p>So far so good, right? But the issue of what is a dwelling gets muddier for anyone who lives in shared spaces, like a condominium in a multi-unit building. Most people recognize that common areas, such as hallways, mailrooms, and recreation centers, may be part of the building where they live, but aren’t actually their dwelling. The real question is where does one dwelling end and the other begin.</p>\n<p>Typically, dwelling means everything from the walls in for your particular unit in the condominium. So the dwelling coverage in your <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> most likely pays for damage to things like your:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Floors.</li>\n<li>Interior walls.</li>\n<li>Ceiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the installation, wiring, and drywall, that’s usually covered by your condo association’s master policy. Some master policies even cover built-in fixtures for individual units.</p>\n<p>Renters probably have the easiest time with the definition of dwelling for insurance. They live in a dwelling, but they don’t own it, so the only items they have an <a href=\"/glossary/insurable-interest/\">insurable interest</a> in are their own personal belongings.</p>\n<p>As you can see, understanding what dwelling means actually depends somewhat on your situation ﹘ at least when it comes to insurance. But that also means understanding the difference is important for getting adequate protection.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisawindhaildeductible\">What Is a Wind / Hail Deductible?</h2>\n<p>Like a <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">standard deductible</a>, a wind / hail deductible is the amount of money you’re responsible for paying out of pocket when you make an insurance claim. However, a wind / hail deductible only applies to damage caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wind.</li>\n<li>Hail.</li>\n<li>A tornado.</li>\n<li>Wind-driven rain events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These deductibles are most common in areas that are at high risk for wind or hail damage, like the states located in <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley</a>, the Great Plains, or the Midwest.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When a loss results from a storm system that the National Hurricane Center names, a hurricane deductible applies, depending on your policy’s language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howwindhaildeductibleswork\">How wind / hail deductibles work</h2>\n<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, insurers widely began to adopt <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductibles</a> in an effort to keep insurance affordable and accessible and spread out risk. The additional deductible improves the insurance company’s ability to pay claims when a catastrophe hits a large number of policyholders.</p>\n<p>Wind / hail deductibles follow this same concept, but are designed for areas of the US that see frequent severe windstorms and tornadoes. For example, if a hail storm damages your roof, you’d be responsible for paying your wind / hail deductible when your insurance provider covers your claim.</p>\n<p>Wind / hail deductibles are typically calculated either as a flat dollar amount or a percentage of your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage (also called Coverage A)</a>. Say you have $300,000 worth of coverage for your dwelling with a one percent wind / hail deductible. That means you'd pay $3,000 out of pocket for a wind or hail claim. If you chose a flat dollar deductible of $2,500, you would pay $2,500 before your insurance policy kicks in to cover the rest of the costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmucharewindhaildeductibles\">How much are wind / hail deductibles?</h2>\n<p>Wind / hail deductible limits vary by provider. Depending on the state and product, we usually offer both flat dollar and percentage options so you can find the right deductible to fit your needs. Our typical deductible limits are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flat dollar amount:</strong> $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000, $7,500, $10,000</li>\n<li><strong>Percentage of Coverage A:</strong> 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While a higher deductible usually translates to lower premiums and can help deter small claims that can increase your premiums over time, consider the amount you can comfortably afford if you have to make a claim with little notice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howisawindhaildeductibledifferentfromastandardorhurricanedeductible\">How is a wind / hail deductible different from a standard or hurricane deductible?</h2>\n<p>Wind / hail deductibles are similar to both standard deductibles and hurricane deductibles. However, each of these are triggered by different events.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at some examples to illustrate that. Say your roof damage was caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>An electrical fire.</strong> A standard deductible, also called an all other perils (AOP) deductible, covers most of the events, or <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a>, that might cause property loss, including fires and theft.</li>\n<li><strong>A hurricane or named storm.</strong> Hurricane deductibles are usually triggered when you experience a loss during a storm named by the National Hurricane Center, but this can vary by state.</li>\n<li><strong>A tornado.</strong> This is when a wind / hail deductible may apply to your claim. Wind/hail deductibles may also apply when hail, wind-driven rain, and other similar events cause damage to your property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your policy may have multiple types of wind damage deductibles, just one, or none at all. It typically depends on where you live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethebenefitsofawindhaildeductible\">What are the benefits of a wind / hail deductible?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, wind / hail deductibles keep <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> more accessible and affordable. By adopting a separate deductible for higher risk scenarios, insurers can continue to provide vital coverage for those living in areas that see frequent severe storms and tornadoes.</p>"

High winds can bring down power lines, tear shingles off your roof, and send debris through your windows. And you don’t have to live in Tornado Alley or along the Gulf Coast to see trouble.</p>\n<p>Even though your <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida home insurance</a> most likely covers windstorms, you may still want to minimize the damage one may cause your house. This process is called wind mitigation, which may help you earn discounts on your home insurance.</p>\n<p>Many insurance providers reduce your premium just for completing a wind mitigation inspection and submitting the report. In fact, a number of coastal states, including Florida and Louisiana, require insurance companies to offer discounts for a certified wind mitigation inspection.</p>\n<p>While any homeowner can benefit from a wind mitigation inspection, those in hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may see the greatest impact on their premium. That’s because the potential for extensive damage in <a href=\"/blog/tornado-alley-hurricane-alley-insurance/\">Tornado Alley and Hurricane Alley</a> has a big impact on insurance prices. Often, insurers require a <a href=\"/glossary/hurricane-deductible/\">hurricane deductible</a> in these areas on top of the standard deductible. It applies to damage caused by hurricanes and windstorms, and the deductible is usually a percentage of your home’s value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetawindmitigationinspection\">How to get a wind mitigation inspection</h2>\n<p>Getting a <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a> starts with hiring a certified inspector. That individual may be a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General contractor.</li>\n<li>Building contractor.</li>\n<li>Architect.</li>\n<li>Engineer.</li>\n<li>Building inspector.</li>\n<li>Home inspector.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inspections typically cost about $100 (depending on where you live) and take 30 minutes to an hour.</p>\n<p>During the inspection, the inspectors will look for wind-resistant features, such as hurricane shutters, impact-resistant windows and doors, water barriers in the roof, the shape of your roof and how it's attached to your roof deck and walls, and more.</p>\n<p>Your inspector may also ask for any prior wind mitigation inspection documents.</p>\n<p>A wind mitigation inspection can add up to substantial savings. For example, Florida homeowners may save hundreds or thousands on their premium. Insurers in your state may not provide as steep a discount, but the extra protection alone may make wind mitigation worth the effort.</p>"
